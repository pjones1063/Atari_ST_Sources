CSV2STOS
Import/Export CSV Data Utility v0.85

Written for users of Tiled & The Missing Link extension for STOS Basic on the Atari ST(e) platform.  

Tiled is a free map editor written for Windows, MacOS & Linux by Thorbjørn.

There are instructions within the program itself to follow also.  Once you get used to using the program, the process is pretty straightforward.  CSV stands for comma-seperated value.

Small portions of code were re-used from the original eddy.bas when the program needs to generate a new map bank for example.  Also some of the file loading/saving routines, from what I recall they were re-used and modified to suit.  Thank you Jon S. Stock for enlightening me regarding the use of opening & closing data channels to create or read in CSV files!  That was a huge help, it enabled me to work out how to write this converter.

Explanation:
1. You can import a *.CSV file exported from Tiled into CSV2STOS, to create a Missing Link compatible world or landscape map.
You must know what the map's width and height are. Check within Tiled or within your *.TMX file first, unless you already know this from memory. Once this information is at hand, you can define the map's width and height at the beginning of the import process.

2. You can export a *.CSV file from a Missing Link world map or landscape map made in eddy.bas to use with Tiled, with a few additional steps required.  
I recommend opening up a Tiled *.TMX map into Notepad or Visual Studio Code to familiarise yourself with how the file structure of a Tiled map works. That way you will understand the next steps below a little better.  

Tiled doesn't allow for direct importing of CSV data yet, but the workaround is just to copy/paste the CSV data into a pre-prepared *.TMX file. So, there is at least some kind of interoperability between CSV2STOS and Tiled. Just make sure the width and height values are set correctly in the *.TMX, and that the filename of your tileset (ie. *.TMS file made from a PNG image file) has been saved into the file.  

You don't have to remove the spaces between the commas of a newly exported *.CSV file (Tiled doesn't seem to mind this), but do remember to remove the very last comma at the end of the data being pasted into your dummy *.TMX file. Again a reminder, study the make-up of a *.TMX file saved from Tiled first in Notepad or similar before attempting this, then you will see what needs to match up.

Another important note, the CSV file you export from an existing missing link map with CSV2STOS.BAS cannot be re-imported back into CSV2STOS, then converted back into a missing link map file.  You have to export a CSV file from your Tiled map first and use this instead!  The values of each tile will then start at the correct number.  I may look into a fix/new option for this in a later version, but it's not really necessary currently as the program does it's job.

Examples of exported missing link maps to use with Tiled have been included, including PNG image files exported from the main *.TMX file(s).  These have all been retrieved from the original extension's examples.  I have added these to v0.85 to demonstrate what is possible with a bit of work.  I also thought some of you would find these of interest!

Speaking of which, if you are using an emulator, I recommend that you use Steem 3.2 or SteemSSE's fast forward button.  Otherwise you may have to wait a while, while the maps are converting.

Tip: Keep an *.MBK of your original sprites, world blocks and a PNG file of the same tileset. It depends what you started with, as to how you create all of these. The *.MBK from the sprite editor, grab.bas, or a NEO converted from an IFF made in Photoshop, or a NEO from ST Paint? You can also generate a tileset image with make.bas, then use the SteemSSE emulator to quickly save off a NEO file of the image. Then you can load this up into ST Paint (for the PC platform) and then save off a PNG image file to use with Tiled.

Make sure these programs & extensions have been installed:
- Tiled
- Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice (so you can view and process CSV file data).
- ST Paint (for the PC, very nicely done!!)
- Photoshop or GIMP (optional, even ST Paint on it's own is fine)
- STOS v3.00 from Exxos's STOS Time Tunnel.  https://www.exxoshost.co.uk/atari/STOS_index.htm
- Misty Extension (Registered)
- The Missing Link extension (Registered)

The extensions listed above can also be found at the STOS Time Tunnel.  I also recommend you apply the patch written by dml for the missing link extension.  This allows you to use tile banks which exceed the original 128 tile limit.

Greetings go out to all STOS users around the world.

AOZ Studio is coming to modern day machines & devices, you will be able to compile to multiple platforms.  There will be support for both STOS & AMOS commands, including the most popular extensions.  Francois Lionet and his team are about to create the magic all over again!
