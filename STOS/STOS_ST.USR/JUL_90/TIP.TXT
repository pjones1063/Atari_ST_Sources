
STOS tip
---------
Kevin Ware-Lane of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, has found an undocumented
feature in STOS BASIC:
    "Create any file, and save it in the root directory of your working copy of
the STOS Basic disk. It must be saved under the file name AUTOEXEC.BAS. Now,
whenever you boot your working copy of STOS, that BASIC program will be loaded
and run."
