                                 Have a ball

                      Oscar Lock presents an attractive
                       update of a familiar board game

SOLITAIRE is an old board game that dates back hundreds of years, but now it
has been brought right up to date with a fresh implementation on the ST. The
game is written in STOS so you'll need to boot the game creator up before
loading SOLITAIR.BAS.
    When you run the program the board will be displayed on the left hand side
of the screen and a control panel can be seen on the right. The aim of the game
is to move one ball over another into an empty space on the other side. A ball
that has been jumped over like this is removed from the board. Try to remove
all the balls by jumping them to leave just one ball in the centre hole.
    To move a ball just click on one using the mouse pointer then click again
on the empty hole you want to jump to. The program will refuse to move a ball
if it is an illegal move.
    At the top of the control panel is a cross and a skull; the former resets
the board for a new game while the latter quits back to STOS. The GET at the
foot of the panel takes back your last go and the numbers in the middle change
the board to a different layout, providing a new challenge after you have
completed the easiest level.
