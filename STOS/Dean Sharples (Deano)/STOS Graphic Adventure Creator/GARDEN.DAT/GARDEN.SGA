You are on a large hill which is your home, overlooking the land of Morlic. The place seems to be quite peaceful  with the merry chirping of the birds  and the soft cool air.
This is grannies house, a nice little place with lush red drapes covering   the window. The place seems to be bareexcept for a small rug and you can    hear the chilling sound of granny     singing in her bath. You see a door.
As you approach the lake you see a    weird looking man who just stands and stares at you. You can see a signpost pointing to an hill. The man looks at you and says 'I am the keeper of the  lake, what do you want of me'.
You stand before the mighty castle of the wicked witch which many people    have feared. You can see a signpost   and an open drawbridge.
You find youself in the haunted forestwhich is the home of mice and bats    that scurry away into the night. You  only see trees, bushes and a signpost.
You are in the church of St Matthews  which must be over a hundred years    old. The rest of the church lies      behind a locked door behind you but   you do see the main door.
You find yourself facing three doors  in a corridor. The corridor is dusty  with a damp floor and an bad smell.   You must open the right door or you   will be destroyed, a large archway    stands at one end of the corridor.
a fruit cake.
a tub of water.
a small key.
a fur coat.
a tin goblet.
The cake looks good enough to eat.
It's a large wooden tub of water.
The key is made out of chrome and has the word 'Yale' on it.
The coat is torn and has no pockets.
Inside the goblet is some holy water.
You walk up to the man and say hello, but he just glares at you. Then he    groans and says 'I'm hungry, if you   give me a key to eat then I will give you some water from my lake'.
You give the key to the man and he    pops it in his mouth and eats it. He  thanks you, then gets a large wooden  tub and fills it with water then puts it down by your feet.
An elf comes running out of the forestand shouts 'Help me please, the witch has set my forest on fire, have you   got any water to put it out'?
You use the tub of water on the fire  and it goes out. The elf dances with  joy, and with a big smile on his face gives you a cake for your help.
You try to enter the castle but the   guard won't let you.
A guard stops you and says 'if you    want to gain entrance to this castle  then you must give me a cake'.
The guard takes the cake and smiles,  he says 'Thank you friend, you may    enter the castle, good luck'.
When you open the door a large ugly   troll appears and stabs you to death. As you slump to the ground you hear   the cries of the children and the     laugher of the witch. You are dead.
You open the door and a strange littleman pops out and starts to choke you. You croak and pass out just after you hear the laughter of the witch. You   have failed to save the children, I   don't think granny will like that.
You open the door and the wicked witchappears. She screeches 'The children  are mine, you will have to beat me to rescue them'.
The goblet breaks open and the water  melts the witch into a pulp.                                                Well done, you have rescued all the   children, and just in time for tea.
