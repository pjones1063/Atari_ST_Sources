				 Chapter one

			     (Planning the game)

 Before we can go about writing a Graphic Adventure, we need to  
 plan it out on paper before entering it into Stos. Even though 
 you have a good idea of your games plan you will still need some 
 notes to refer to otherwise you could end up getting stuck in the 
 middle of it and end up in a right mess.

 Creating an adventure game is like making a film, it would take 
 place in a created fantasy world with a plot and a goal to aim 
 for. So we need to decide what our adventure is going to be 
 about, it could be a knight in shining armour who has to rescue a 
 princess from a fire breathing dragon or an ape who has to escape 
 from the zoo and go back to the forest.

 Lets say we were going to write a game about a school which is 
 haunted and the main character is a school boy who has to rescue 
 his friend and get out of the school alive. We can start by 
 defining the locations you would find in a school, the list would 
 look something like this.

  1)  Main Hall
  2)  Assembly Hall
  3)  Caretakers Room
  4)  Headmasters Study
  5)  Staffroom
  6)  School Corridor
  7)  Classroom One
  8)  Classroom Two
  9)  Classroom Three
 10)  School Library

 So here we have a list of locations or rooms that make up the 
 game world which in this case is a school. What we need now is a 
 way for the player to get to each location.

   Connections 

 Think of a jigsaw. This consists of a load of pieces which are 
 joined together to form a complete picture. This is the same as 
 joining locations together, each one would be joined to the 
 nearest. Lets take the above example, the first location is the 
 main hall of the school and the nearest locations or rooms would 
 be the Headmasters Office, the Caretakers Room, Staffroom and the 
 Headmasters Office or Study.

 The Sgac allows you to join or connect five locations to one, you 
 can see an example in Grannies Garden, as you see the first 
 picture shows icons of the other locations and you can go there 
 by selecting Leave from the option bar and clicking on one of the 
 icons. This is location number one and is locations 2,3,4,5 and 6 
 are connected to it. So really, connections are a fancy name for 
 exits. Each exit would lead to another location.

 This is an important stage of an adventure game, if a player 
 tries to enter a bathroom and appears in an airport then he's 
 most likely to discard the game as he will think its full of 
 mistakes and quickly lose interest in the whole game.

   Puzzles 

 If the player could go straight to the end of the game then it 
 would'nt be very interesting, so what we do is set a few puzzles 
 and traps that he must overcome to complete the game.

 At the moment, the player will be able to freely walk around our 
 school adventure so lets make it a bit harder for him, we'll put 
 a locked door in the Main Hall location so the player will have 
 to find a way of unlocking the door so he can enter either one of 
 the other rooms or locations there.

 This is known as a 'false exit' and is used in Grannies Garden, 
 try going to the castle and then entering it, you are told that 
 the guard won't let you in unless you give him a cake. So how do 
 you get the cake???, well you have other puzzles to solve first.

 If you have ever read any Detective books, then you will see that 
 there are puzzles and problems that the Detective has to overcome 
 before finding the Murderer, so by putting them in your games you 
 are providing a challenge to the player who has to get past all 
 these puzzles to solve his quest.

 Now we can begin putting our plan together on paper.

   Locations and connecting them 

 Sgac uses a method called 'Exit Zones' for moving to each 
 location, this consists of setting up an area on screen which the 
 player can click on to go to the chosen location.

 Lets look at the school game plan, location number one is the 
 main hall which leads to the Headmasters Office, the Assembly 
 Hall, the caretakers room and the staffroom, so we have four
 Exit Zones from this location. So we can note it down like this 
 along with the other locations and their Exit Zones.

   Location                         Exit Zones                     
   
  1) School Main Hall               Z1=2, Z2=3, Z3=4, Z4=5
  2) Headmasters Office             Z1=1
  3) Caretakers Room                Z1=1
  4) Staffroom                      Z1=1
  5) Assembly Hall                  Z1=1, Z2=6
  6) School Corridor                Z1=5, Z2=7, Z3=8, Z4=9, Z5=10
  7) Classroom One                  Z1=6
  8) Classroom Two                  Z1=6
  9) Classroom Three                Z1=6
 10) School Library                 Z1=6

 So as you see, from location number one, we have Exit Zones 
 leading to locations 2,3,4 and 5, the Z1 and Z2 indicates this, 
 so Z1 means Exit Zone number one leads to location 2 and Z2 means 
 Exit Zone number 2 leads to location 3 (Z=Zone).

 Now thats done, lets note down the puzzles and traps along with 
 the game plot. Connections end here for now which in my books is 
 the most boring part of planning. The wife likes Connections, in 
 fact every night her fist connects with my face, the other day I 
 asked the guy in the pet shop if he could give me a dog for her 
 but he said he did'nt do swaps.

 Fortunately, writing an adventure is a lot easier than putting up 
 with women, there are less mysteries to solve.

 Lets note down a few puzzles and traps for the game.

                                                                   

  1) The door leading to the Headmasters Office is locked and the 
     player must find the key to unlock it.

  2) There is a large dog in the Caretakers Office so the player 
     must give it a bone so he can enter.

  3) The player can only enter the Staffroom if he's wearing the 
     Teachers Gown.

  4) If the player tries to enter the Caretakers Office without 
     giving the dog the bone then it will attack.

  5) If the player enters the Staffroom and he is'nt wearing the 
     Teachers Gown then he will be handed to the police.

 So here we have three puzzles and two traps, look at the traps, 
 each trap ends the game for the player. Talking about traps, I 
 wish the wife would shut hers...

   Objects and their locations 

 Objects are things that can be picked up and carried by the 
 player, In fact three of them are mentioned in the puzzles and 
 traps section (Oh Shut Up woman!!!) above, these are a Key, a 
 Bone, and a Teachers Gown.

 These objects are there to help the player on his quest and they 
 have two locations (Normal and Special), the normal Object 
 Locations are used if you want the object to appear at a certain 
 location in your game waiting for the player to pick it up.

 The Special Object Locations are as followed....

   Object carried 

 The object is carried by the player allowing him to do anything 
 he wants with it such as drop it, or use it.

   Object Worn 

 The object is worn by the player, such an object could be a piece 
 of clothing or even a wristwatch.

   Object N-C 

 The object is N-C (Not Created) and does not as yet exist in the 
 game. The object will enter the game when the player finds it.

 The objects can be listed on paper like this....

     Object                      Location                     

  1) Key                          Location 1
  2) Bone                         Object Carried
  3) Gown                         Object Worn
  4) Knife                        Object N-C

 Here we've added an extra object, a knife which could come in 
 useful as the friend the player is going to rescue could be tied 
 up somewhere and the knife can be used to cut the ropes.

   Game Events 

 These are used to perform the outcome of the players command, for 
 example we could use one to created a not created object when the 
 player opens a box or examines a coat.

 We can also use one to if the player finds his friend, the friend 
 could be tied up in a cupboard and found when the player opens 
 it. This events can be noted down like this....

                                                                   

  1) When the player opens the large chest in the Staffroom he 
     finds the knife.

  2) When the player gives the dog the bone the dog takes it and 
     lets the player enter the Caretakers Office.

  3) If the player uses the key on the door of the Headmasters 
     office the door will unlock and he can enter.

 When the event is carried out the game will perform an action, 
 for example, if the player did use the key on the door then the 
 computer will connect the main hall to the Headmasters office 
 thus creating the exit from the main hall to the Office.

 Event 2 checks if the dog has been given the bone, in this case 
 the bone would become a not created object and leave the game and 
 a varible is set to indicate that the dog has eaten it.

 More on this later on so stay tuned to this channel.

   Graphics 

 To create a Graphic Adventure you will need an art package, which 
 can be obtained from a PD library for about œ3. All graphics  
 need to be kept to the size of about half a screen so for this  
 reason I have included on disk, a picture file in Degas (pi1)  
 format which can be loaded into your own art package. If you can't 
 draw then don't worry, maybe you have a  friend who can draw, I'm 
 sure he'll do it for some fags.

 When an artist draws a picture, he always draws a mock up of the 
 picture just to get the angles right and make sure everything is 
 in the right place. This is what we should do before we complete 
 creating our adventure. 

 Load your art package then load the Frame.pi1 file, you will see 
 a large box, your graphics go in here so when you draw your 
 picture it must be kept inside this box.

 Lets do a mock up of the hallway location, this has four Exit 
 Zones so just draw four boxes on screen then save it on a 
 seperate disk. Now with the same picture on screen, lets alter 
 it, rub three boxes out so you just leave one inside the frame 
 and save it on the same disk with the first picture.

 The first box is a mock up of the picture of location one in our 
 school adventure, which is the Main Hall location and the boxes 
 are the four Exit Zones. The second picture with the one box on 
 it is location 2 (Headmasters Office) with one Exit Zone.

 You may change all the palette colours for your picture but you 
 must keep colours 0 and 1 black and white, the reason for this is 
 explained later.

 The next thing to do with the finished graphics is to pack them 
 and save them as .mbk files, using the Stos compact accessory.

 There is one other rule, the compacted pictures must be saved 
 with these names only like this...

   Pic1.mbk       (picture for location one)
   Pic2.mbk       (picture for location two)

 So the name should be "Pic"+location number+".mbk", look in the 
 Garden.dat folder and view the filenames for its pictures.

   Location Descriptions 
   
 The location description is used to describe the current location 
 but it must not memtion any objects. The location description for 
 the Headmasters office would something like this...

  You are inside the Headmasters Office, the carpet looks old and 
  worn and the walls are decorated with Trophys. A large desk and a 
  comfy swivel chair stand in the corner. You see a door.

 So location 2 goes with picture 2.

 An important rule to remember is that the location description 
 must only imform the player of things that stay the same, for 
 example you can't say 'You see an open door' because a door can 
 easily be opened and closed and you can't say the clock says 
 something like five o clock because time changes.

 Well thats the end of this chapter, maybe you could think of more 
 bits and pieces for the game, maybe define more locations, objects
 and puzzles. In chapter three I will be showing you more stuff to 
 make your game interesting.

 Remember, the more time spent on planning a game, the greater it 
 becomes. In Chapter 2, we are going to look at the creator.
