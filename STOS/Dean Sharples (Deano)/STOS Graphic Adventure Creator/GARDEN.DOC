				 The Story 

 One sunny afternoon in the land of Morlic, the children were 
 playing in Grannies Garden when the Wicked Witch came and took 
 them to her castle. Granny dropped her teapot and ran outside 
 just in time to see the children sat on the back of the Witches 
 broomstick screaming for help.

 In this game, you have been lumbered with the task of destroying 
 the Wicked Witch and rescuing the children. You will have to 
 overcome various puzzles before you gain entrance to the castle.

 So lets begin our quest and please try not to laugh at the 
 graphics. Granny wants the children home in time for tea.
