             in STOS Basic


     This  program  will work  on  any 
Atari  ST computer and in  interpreted 
mode  will  work in any  resolution  ( 
low,  medium,  or high ).  Compiled it 
will  work  in  either  low  and  high 
resolution,   or   medium   and   high 
resolution  depending on the  compiler 
options.

     On   the  disk  should   be   the 
following files :

     TYPING.PRG  - compiled version
     TYPING.ACB  - accessory version
     TYPING.BAS  - basic version
     LETTERS.LSN - lesson data
     MANUAL.DOC

     Load  the program  normally  from 
the desktop,  double-click as usual on 
'TYPING.PRG'.  It can also be made  to 
autorun  by  placing  it  in  an  auto 
folder.

     When  the  program has  loaded  a 
message will be displayed showing that 
data   is  loading,   at  this   point 
'LETTERS.LSN'  is  being  loaded  into 
memory.

     The   main  menu  will  then   be 
displayed, as show below:

             Main Menu

         1. Start Lesson
         2. Practice typing
         3. Type a document
         4. Keyboard test
         5. Credits
         6. Options
         7. Exit

     To  select  an option  press  the 
appropriate number key.


1. Start Lesson

     If  there  is  not  a  lesson  in 
memory  then  a  warning  will  appear 
informing  that  a  lesson  should  be 
loaded using the 'Load lesson' option.

     If a lesson is in memory a screen 
will be shown with the current lesson, 
and the text which you have to type.

eg.

            Lesson : 001
     Press 'Escape' to finish.


this is a quick test. a b c d e f g

stos basic the game creator...
               

     As you type you text will  appear 
underneath the original text, what you 
type  will have to match  exactly  the 
original in order to have an  accuracy 
of  100%.  At the end of each line  it 
doesn't  matter whether you press  the 
'return' key or any other key.

     Once  the whole lesson  has  been 
typed your mistakes will be indicated, 
and  the number of mistakes  made.  If 
you didn't make any mistakes then  you 
will  skip  straight  to  the  results 
screen.  The result screen  will  show 
the following :

  a) the number of words you typed.
  b) the number of mistakes you made.
  c) your percentage accuracy.
  d) your speed in words per minute.

     If  you  have  not  obtained  the 
required   speed   or   the   required 
accuracy  the pass speed  or  accuracy 
will be displayed,  and you will  have 
the option of re-typing that lesson  ( 
press 'y' ).
The  lessons will continue  until  you 
either press 'Escape' or you reach the 
last lesson.


2. Practice Typing

     This  is  similar  to  an  actual 
lesson  with the exception that  there 
is  no restrictions on what you  type. 
You  can  type anything and  once  you 
reach  the  bottom of the  screen  you 
will  be  presented with a  new  clear 
one.        Once  you  have   finished 
typing press 'Escape' and the  results 
will be shown, as in option number 1.


3. Type a document

     Again this is in a similar format 
to the first option with the exception 
that  lessons  are  not   typed,   but 
instead  a document of your choice  is 
typed.
     If  no  document is in  memory  a 
warning  will appear informing you  to 
load a document from the options menu.


4. Keyboard Test

     This   is   a   simple   keyboard 
reaction timer, when selected you will 
be  asked for the number of keys [  10 
to  50 ],  this is the number of  keys 
you will have to type in the test.
     When the test begins a picture of 
the  keyboard will displayed with  one 
of the letters highlighted, press this 
a  quickly as possible.  This will  be 
repeated  for the number of  keys  you 
selected.
     At  the end your results will  be 
shown, including :

     a) time taken
     b) number of keys
     c) number of keys a second


5. Credits

     This just simply displays a small 
message  about the  program,  and  the 
people who actually tested the program 
for bugs.


6. Options

     If   this  option   is   selected 
another menu is displayed :

            Options Menu

          1) Select lesson
          2) Select music
          3) Load document
          4) Load lesson
          5) Set key speed
          6) Set key delay
          7) Main menu

1) Select lesson
     This  allows you to start on  any 
lesson between 1 and the last  lesson. 
This  option  is only available  if  a 
lesson is currently in memory.


2) Select music
     This  options allows you to  have 
music playing whilst participating  in 
the lessons,  etc. Music numbers 13 to 
21  are from the original  STOS  Basic 
package.


3) Load document
     This  option allows you  to  load 
any  file as a document and then  type 
it  as  you  would  a  normal  lesson. 
     This   option  will   display   a 
standard STOS file-selector with which 
you  can select the document you  wish 
to load.
     The majority of files can be used 
as any illegal characters are  omitted 
from the lesson.

Note:
     This  option wipes  all  previous 
documents, and lessons from memory.


4) Load lesson
     This option is as the above  with 
the  exception  of load  lesson  data, 
only  valid lesson data files will  be 
loaded.

Note:
     This  option wipes  all  previous 
documents, and lessons from memory.


5,6) Select Key Speed/Delay
     These options are very similar as 
they   allow  you  to  customise   the 
keyboard  speed and delay,  (  as  you 
would  on  the Control  panel  on  the 
desktop ).


7) Main Menu
     This  simple returns you  to  the 
main menu.


7) Exit

     Exit the program.
