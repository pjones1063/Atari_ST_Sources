The EXTRA installation program by Martin Cubitt          8th August 1993


     NOTE: The program has been packed and may take a while to unpack.


     The program INSTALL.PRG will allow you to select which of the three 
files associated to EXTRA you wish to save. You will obviously need the 
interpreter version in order to use the commands. The compiler version is 
there for those of you who have the STOS compiler . The document file for
EXTRA is over 50K itself and is a pretty comprehensive manual with
detailed command descriptions and examples throughout.

     To install the selected file simply click the mouse over the 
appropriate box on the screen. When you have finished installing EXTRA you 
should click on QUIT to exit the program.

     Once ALL of the three files have been installed this installation 
program is of no use to you for it has served its purpose!

     If you go into the wrong option and want to exit the file selector 
you should note that you must enter the word EXIT as the file name to 
correctly quit the option. Clicking on QUIT on the STOS file selector has 
the same effect as clicking on OK!

     I suggest that you read the EXTRA.DOC file before attempting to use 
the commands as some can be damaging if used incorrectly (ie the format 
disc command should be used carefully!). Ideally you would print the .DOC 
file to make reference easy.


     Most of all I hope that you find the EXTRA commands useful. If you 
have any queries regarding the commands, or STOS in general, please 
contact me but make sure you have read the documentation first. Send a 
stamped addressed envelope if you expect a reply!
