                              Old favourite

              Geoffrey Wright brings an old game up to date

SOME old traditional pastimes are ideal for converting to a computer-based
game, but others are difficult to imagine on the computer screen. Tiddlywinks
belongs to the latter class of games - how can this be converted? Geoffrey
Wright has performed the impossible and re-designed this old favourite, coding
it in Fast BASIC. Youngsters will enjoy this easy-to-play game and learn how to
control the ST's mouse at the same time.
    The aim, of course, is to flip your counters into the ring in the middle of
the screen. Point at the edge of a counter using the mouse and then click the
button to flip it. It's frustrating trying to flip those counters in, but
practise makes perfect.
    Boot up Fast BASIC and load TIDDLEWK.BSC then click on the Run option.
