                             RUBIK'S CLOCK


More frustrating than Rubic's cube is his fascinating clock. Can you solve the
puzzle of the dials? If you're having problems then try the following
solution:

1. Hold the puzzle with the front face towards you and with the Rubik signature
at the bottom.

2. Press the top left button down and the other three buttons up. Turn the top
left thumbwheel until the top left clock is at 12 o'clock. Repeat in a similar
manner for the other three corner clocks.

3. Press the top left button up and the other three buttons down. Turn the top
left thumbwheel until the top center clock is at 12 o'clock. (Count the number
of clicks needed to do it.) Press the top left button down and the top right
button up. Turn the top right thumbwheel the same number of clicks in the same
direction. Press the top left button up. Turn the two top thumbwheels the same
number of clicks in the opposite direction. The top three clocks should now be
at 12 o'clock.

4. Repeat in a similar manner for the right hand side then the bottom three
clocks, then the left hand side. All the front face clocks except the center
clock should now be at 12 o'clock.

5. Press the top left button up and the other three buttons down. Turn the top
left thumbwheel until the center clock is at 12 o'clock. (Count the number of
clicks needed to do it.) Press the top left button down and the bottom right
button up. Turn the bottom right thumbwheel the same number of clicks in the
same direction. Press the top left button up. Turn the top left and bottom
right thumbwheels the same number of clicks in the opposite direction. All nine
clocks should now be at 12 o'clock.

6. Turn the puzzle over (dark blue clocks towards you) with Rubik's Clock at
the top.The four corner clocks should be at 12 o'clock. 7. Repeat paragraphs
3-5 for the back face. All 18 clocks should now be at 12 o'clock. Puzzle
completed.
