802_REQU.BAS is a T-Basic program that automatically downloads the
performance and all current voice edit buffers from the TX-802.  This can
be then be written to a single KCS sequence or saved to disk as a single
midiex file.  The file contains sysex commands for all the appropriate
button presses so that the voices will re-load into the correct tone
generators.  I wrote this program because X-Or trashes any edited voice
when you select "get performance".

This program works only if T-Basic is in the MPE.  To use it standalone
you would have to include a routine to enlarge the ST's default midi
buffer to avoid locking up the computer when receiving data from the 802.

When you run the program you'll first see an alert box asking if you are
using fractional scaling in any of the current voices.  If not, just hit
return or select "Nope" and the program will do its thing.  If you answer
"Yep" you'll get a graphic where you choose which of the active voices you
need the F.S. info for.  I included this because each F.S. buffer uses 510
bytes (which becomes 3060 bytes if saved in a .SEQ file) and most of the
time you don't need it!  Also, you can use fractional scalings for every
voice in your performance without having to store it to a cartridge.

After everything has been downloaded you'll get an alert box allowing you
to choose whether to write the file as a KCS sequence (it will go to the
first one available) or save it to disk as a midiex file.  Be aware that
in order to send the midiex file back to the 802 successfully, your
software must support multiple sysex messages and delays between sending
them (Harry Wootan's shareware ST Midiex program does both).
