This simple T-Basic program does an "all tracks to all sequences"
operation.  Rather than mixing multiple tracks to one sequence as with the
standard KCS "all tracks to sequence" option, TRK_SEQS.BAS copies each
individual track to an individual sequence.  I wrote this program based on
an idea of James Wyman's, who wanted to use the new Song Editor module as
a kind of "super track mode", where each line in the S.E. acts as a
"track" but with the added flexibilities offered by the S.E.
 
The track names are copied to the new sequences, and the sequence comments
tell the track number it came from.  The next available sequences are
used, with the exception of the backup sequences Y and Z.
