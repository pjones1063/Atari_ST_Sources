MORE ON USING THE EDITOR

The editor is now capable of editing two files at a time.
TO ENTER THE EDITOR, type 'edit' and then select a file from the file
selector box (or, type in the name of a file you'd like to create). A
window will appear with your file in it. TO OPEN A SECOND FILE, press
alt-O (for 'Open') or click in the main window and type 'edit' again.
Follow the same procedure as before for opening a second file.

TO USE THE EDITOR, there are a number of Word-Star-like commands (press
the 'Help' key for a list of them) but it's intended to be a mouse-driven
editor. The key board commands are covered in the manual. The manual, however,
assumed knowledge of Macintosh-style text editing. This has proved to be a
bad assumption, hence this file. It is still assumed though, that you know
how to move, re-size, close, scroll in, and select a GEM window.

TO MOVE THE CURSOR (TEXT INSERTION POINT), click on the desired location
with your mouse. The flashing vertical bar is where any text that is typed
will be entered. The editor is always in 'insert' mode.

A SELECTION is a highlighted section of text that can be copied to the
clipboard, replaced with the contents of the clipboard, replaced with the
next key pressed (careful!), or deleted by pressing the backspace key.

TO MAKE A SELECTION, click on one end of the section you want to select and,
without letting the mouse button up, dragging to the other end of the text
you want to select; or, by holding the shift key down and clicking on an end
of text you want to select, the text from the current cursor location to that
point will be highlighted and made the current selection. You can also
extend a selection with the shift-click method. WARNING: a selection may be
deleted (forever) at any time by hitting any text key.

TO MOVE BLOCKS OF TEXT, you must first 'copy' or 'cut' a selection to the
'clipboard'. Pressing 'alt-X' (that is, holding down the 'Alt' key while
typing an 'X') will CUT the selection from the file and put it in the
clipboard. Pressing 'alt-C' will COPY the selection to the clipboard.
TO PASTE this text somewhere else, pick a new insertion point (in EITHER
file) and press alt-V. The selection will be inserted into that spot.
Any cut or copy will wipe out the previous contents of the clipboard.

TO FIND STRINGS, press 'Alt-F' and type in the string you wish to find.
Hit return, if the string is found, it will be highlighted. Pressing 'Alt-F'
again will search for the next occurrence of the string without bringing
up the dialog box. (This happens when the selected text matches whatever's
stored into the dialog box's text field). The search is not case-sensitive
is only in one direction (to the end of the file). If no match is found the
cursor will be placed at the top of the file. If you select a piece of
text less than 12 characters long and then press 'Alt-F', the dialog
box will pop up with that text displayed. You can then hit return or click
in the 'ok' box for it to search for the next occurrence. WARNING: any
selected text may be wiped out by a key press.

All other functions (saving, quitting, saving under a new name) are
done from the key board.

The whole point of this integrated editor is for fast loading and
turn-around. TO LOAD A FILE FROM THE EDITOR, you MUST be in the main
(Mach 2 v1.00) window. Select 'Load-Edit' from the 'File' menu. Mach 2
will load from edit window that is closest to the front (if you close the
editor, you can't load a file from it- losing the speed advantage). If
there is an error during loading, click back to the edit window. The cursor
will be pointing at the spot where the error occurred.

THIS IS A MEMORY-BASED EDITOR. SAVE YOUR CHANGES PERIODICALLY (with the
F3 key).
