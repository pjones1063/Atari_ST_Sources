DEFINITION Form; (* SJ 9.5.93 *)

(* This TOS version of module Form only replaces Form.Alert. It has
   the same procedure number as in GEM module Form, so that a TOS program
   can be developped with the GEM version and than be linked with the TOS
   version. This module was written because some basic modules like Error
   use Form.Alert. Now these modules can be used in TOS programs as well.
*)


PROCEDURE Alert* (Defbut : INTEGER; Text : ARRAY OF CHAR) : INTEGER;

(* expects the same parameters as the GEM version of Form.Alert. The
   alert string is changed so that it can be written on IO and the
   buttons are written with the first character in parenthesis. The user
   can select a button by pressing the key with the first character.

END Form.
