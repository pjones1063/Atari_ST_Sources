DEFINITION XIO; (* SJ *)

(* XIO (eXtended IO) extends the TOS or GEM IO module with the possibility 
   to execute batch files and to redefine commands (alias).
*)


PROCEDURE ReadLine(VAR Line : ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* behaves the same as IO.ReadLine, but if a batch file is loaded, the
   line is read from the file rather than from the keyboard. The line is
   scanned for idents which are defined as alias and replaces them with
   the stored strings. If a special function key is pressed and an alias
   is stored for that key, the string is returned in Line, if no alias is
   stored, reading continues without leaving ReadString.
   If the line was read from a file, IO.WriteLn is called after writing
   the line. If it was input from keyboard, IO.Return is called. If a
   special function key was pressed, the cursor is set to column 0 of the
   current row.
*)

PROCEDURE LoadBatch(Name : ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* loads the file with name Name. The following calls of ReadLine read
   lines out of that batch file until the end is reached. Then reading
   automatically continues from keyboard. A batch file is allowed to
   call another batch file.
*)

PROCEDURE StoreIdentAlias(VAR Ident,Alias : ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* stores the string Alias in order to replace every use of Ident by Alias *)


PROCEDURE StoreKeyAlias(Shift : SET; Scan : INTEGER; VAR Alias : ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* stores the string Alias in order to replace every press of the key
   combination Shift and Scan by Alias
*)

PROCEDURE ListAlias;

(* lists all stored alias (ident and key alias) on IO *)
