VAR
  Basepage* : basepage;
  (*
   points to the basepage of the linked program or, wenn running as module
   to the basepage of OBERON.PRG. In the commandline of the basepage,
   Loader.Call writes the Command given to it. Modules that use the feature
   of taking parameters, can read them out of the variable Basepage.Command.
   When running as a stand alone program, Basepage points to the basepage
   of the program and parameters are also in Basepage.Command. Notice
   that you can test if your program is called as an accessory, then
   Basepage.Parent is 0
   *)

  Halt* : haltproc;
  (*
   this procedure is called if a HALT-command occurs. The parameter is the
   same as the one of HALT in the source file. System links a procedure
   which calls GEMDOS.Pterm. Oberon links a procedure which show an alert
   where the user can choose to cancel running, debug or continue. You
   can link your own routine if you wish
   *)

  Loader*,ModuleCall* : BOOLEAN;
  (*
   Loader is TRUE if running under the oberon load time linking environment.
   Then ModuleCall is TRUE if the module was called, else a single procedure
   from the module is called
   *)

  MiNT*   : BOOLEAN;
  (*
   TRUE if running under MiNT, the multitasking environment
   *)

  FPU*    : BOOLEAN;
  (*
   TRUE if there is a floating point unit. (set if there is a cookie "_FPU")
   *)

  (*
   TRUE if the _CPU cookie has a value of $1E = 68030

   TRUE if the program was started as an accessory

  compDate* : ARRAY 12 OF CHAR;
  (*
   This string always contains the date of compilation of the main
   module. The format is "tt.mm.jjjj". The loaders and the linker
   set this string when linking.
   *)

  compTime* : ARRAY 10 OF CHAR;
  (*
   similar to compDate. Can also be displayed while developping. Is
   normally not displayed in programs. Format is "hh:mm:ss".
