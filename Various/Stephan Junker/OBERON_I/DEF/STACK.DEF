DEFINITION Stack; (* generic ADT stack 1.0. By D. Theisen *)

(* You should not use Top or Empty. They are inefficient, *)

(* Use stack^ and (stack=NIL) instead.                    *)

(* Note: Initialize a stack with NIL. Stack points to the *)
(*       top of the stack. NIL, if empty.                 *)
