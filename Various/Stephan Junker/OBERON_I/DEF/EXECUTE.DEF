DEFINITION Execute;  (* Stephan Junker  20.11.93 *)

(*
 * Module Execute should be used by modules which run under the loader
 * as well as in stand alone program and it calls code which is available
 * as object module or stand alone program. Just call Exec with the name
 * of the program, and it determines whether to start a module or a program.
 *
 * Details:
 *  There are two versions: STD\EXECUTE.OBJ always calls a program with
 *  GEMDOS.Pexec, LTL\EXECUTE.OBJ is included in OBERON.PRG and always
 *  calls a module.
 *)


PROCEDURE Exec*( name, command : ARRAY OF CHAR) : BOOLEAN;
  (*
   * If the module is running under the loader, Exec tries to call the
   * object module with the given name. You can assign a full path name,
   * because the file name is extracted for module start. If the module
   * is running without the loader, GEMDOS.Pexec is used to call the
   * program. command is the commandline parameter for the program. The
   * environment passed on is the same as defined by Sys.Basepage.Env.
   * Exec returns false if the execution failed and displays an error
   * message.

END Execute.
