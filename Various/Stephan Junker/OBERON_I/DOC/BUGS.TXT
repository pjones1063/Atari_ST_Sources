Known bugs in V2.13
-------------------

- Emulation of FPU commands with size double does not work with addressing
  modes "Address register indirect with predecrement" and "Address register
  indirect with postincrement" (just for assembler programmers)

- TRUNC and ENTIER do not work exactly the same way when using emulation
  or FPU and, even worse, do not work the way they should.

- The browser does not work at all. Is there someone willing to fix it?

- The support of RSD with Peacebug does not work anymore. Don't know why.
