Some simple tips.

to copy one bitplane to another use a modified screen address,

e.g.    screen=950016
bitplane two  =950018
bitplane three=950020
bitplane four =950022

This is for ST low rez only, things change with other resolutions, but
as most ST users will be working in low rez then it's fine.
Copying from one plane to another leads to some neat effects and doing
just one bitplane is really quick, try taking the VSYNC command out
of the BASIC demo to see the speed.


LOGIC OPERATORS.

The most common operator is number 3 which gives a basic copy covering
anything currently at the destination.
One trick is to copy the actual screen to itself using operator number
0, this gives a fast CLS operation, you can do this on small sections
of the screen as well.


Full list of operator numbers:

0       all bits are cleared
1       source AND destination
2       source AND NOT destination
3       source only
4       NOT source AND destination
5       destination only (not much use)
6       source XOR destination
7       source OR destination
8       NOT source AND NOT destination
9       NOT source XOR destination
10      NOT destination (reverse image)
11      source OR NOT destination
12      NOT source (reverse image)
13      NOT source OR destination
14      NOT source OR NOT destination
15      all bits set (sort of fill)

Remember these are bitwise logic operations, the best way to see what
happens is to try out the different effects.
