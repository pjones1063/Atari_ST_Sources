This is a very simple program, all it does is to pick numbers at 
random, but following lottery conventions, the range of numbers is 
1-49 inclusive, and no number can be selected twice.

So the program will pick 6 different numbers and sort them into 
ascending order, the numbers are then converted into strings and 
placed into a dialog box structure so they can easily be displayed.
