General MIDI / General MIDI Standard

	On MIDI sound modules (ie, whose Patches are instrumental sounds), it became
desirable to define a standard set of Patches in order to make sound modules
more compatible. For example, it was decided that Patch number 1 on all sound
modules should be the sound of an Acoustic Grand Piano. In this way, no matter
what MIDI sound module you use, when you change to Patch number 1, you always
hear some sort of Acoustic Grand Piano sound. A standard was set for 128 Patches
which must appear in a specific order, and this standard is called General MIDI
(GM). For example, Patch number 25 on a GM module must be a Nylon String Guitar.
The chart, GM Patches, shows you the names of all GM Patches, and their
respective Program Change numbers.

	The patches are arranged into 16 "families" of instruments, with each family
containing 8 instruments. For example, there is a Reed family. Among the 8
instruments within the Reed family, you will find Saxophone, Oboe, and Clarinet.
A GM sound module should be multi-timbral, meaning that it can play MIDI events
upon all 16 channels simultaneously, with a different GM Patch sounding for each
channel. Furthermore, all patches must sound an A440 pitch when receiving a MIDI
note number of 69.

	If the GM module also has a built-in "drum module" (ie, usually one of 16
Parts), then each of that Drum Part's MIDI notes triggers a different drum
sound. The assignments of drum sounds to MIDI notes is shown in the chart, GM
Drum Sounds. The Drum Part is usually set to receive MIDI data on channel 10.

	GM Standard makes it easy for musicians to put Program Change messages in
their MIDI (sequencer) song files, confident that those messages will select the
correct instruments on all GM sound modules, and the song file would therefore
play all of the correct instrumentationautomatically. Furthermore, musicians
need not worry about parts being played back in the wrong octave. Finally,
musicians didn't have to worry that a snare drum part, for example, wouldn't be
played back on a Cymbal.
	The GM spec also spells out other minimum requirements that a GM module
should meet, such as being able to respond to Pitch and Modulation Wheels, and
also be able to play 24 notes simultaneously (with dynamic voice allocation
between the 16 Parts). All of these standards help to ensure that MIDI Files
play back properly upon setups of various equipment.

	The GM standard is actually not encompassed in the MIDI specification, and
there's no reason why someone can't set up the Patches in his sound module to be
entirely different sounds than the GM set. After all, most MIDI sound modules
offer such programmability. But, most have a GM option so that musicians can
easily play the many MIDI files that expect a GM module.

	Finally, the GM spec spells out a few global settings. For example, the
module should respond to velocity (ie, for note messages). This may be
hard-wired to control the VCA level (ie, volume) of each note. Some modules may
allow velocity to affect other parameters. The pitch wheel bend range should
default to +/- 2 semitones. The module also should respond to Channel Pressure
(often used to control VCA level or VCO level for vibrato depth) as well as the
following MIDI controller messages: Modulation (1) (usually hard-wired to
control LFO amount, ie, vibrato), Channel Volume (7), Pan (10), Expression (11),
Sustain (64), Reset All Controllers (121), and All Notes Off (123). Channel
Volume should default to 90, with all other controllers and effects off
(including pitch wheel offset of 0). Additionally, the module should respond to
these Registered Parameter Numbers: Pitch Wheel Bend Range (0), Fine Tuning (1),
and Coarse Tuning (2). Initial tuning should be standard, A440 reference.

	There is a MIDI System Exclusive message that can be used to turn a module's
General MIDI mode on or off. See the MIDI specification. This is useful for
modules that also offer more expansive, non-GM playback modes or extra,
programmable banks of patches beyond the GM set, but need to allow the musician
to switch to GM mode when desired.

NOTE: The GM spec doesn't dictate how a module produces sound. For example, one
module could use cheap FM synthesis to simulate the Acoustic Grand Piano patch.
Another module could use 24 digital audio waveforms of various notes on a piano,
mapped out across the MIDI note range, to create that one Piano patch.
Obviously, the 2 patches won't sound exactly alike, but at least they will both
be piano patches on the 2 modules. So too, GM doesn't dictate VCA envelopes for
the various patches, so for example, the Sax patch upon one module may have a
longer release time than the same patch upon another module.

Prog# refers to the MIDI Program Change number that causes this Patch to be
selected. These decimal numbers are what the user normally sees on his module's
display (or in a sequencer's "Event List"), but note that MIDI modules count the
first Patch as 0, not 1. So, the value that is sent in the Program Change
message would actually be one less. For example, the Patch number for Reverse
Cymbal is actually sent as 119 rather than 120.
	 But, when entering that Patch number using sequencer software or your
module's control panel, the software or module understands that humans normally
start counting from 1, and so would expect that you'd count the Reverse Cymbal
as Patch 120. Therefore, the software or module automatically does this
subtraction when it generates the MIDI Program Change message.

	So, sending a MIDI Program Change with a value of 120 (ie, actually 119) to
a Part causes the Reverse Cymbal Patch to be selected for playing that Part's
MIDI data.
