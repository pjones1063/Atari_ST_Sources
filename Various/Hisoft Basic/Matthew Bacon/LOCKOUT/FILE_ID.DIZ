LockOUT v1.10 Written by Matthew Bacon for Cadenza Software.
Written using HiSoft BASIC v2.10 within a MagiC v5 multitasking
operating system.

LockOUT's basic function is to act as a simple password protection
accessory.  Any password may be typed in so that when you leave your
Atari to make yet another cup of coffee, you can be sure that nobody
will be able to access your computer (even in a multitasking
environment).
