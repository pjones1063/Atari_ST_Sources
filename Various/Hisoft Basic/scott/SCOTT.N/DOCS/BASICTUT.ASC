	Simple BASIC for Absolute Beginners, by N.W.Scott.

	Many people happily use Applications, Utilities and Games, but only a few have attempted to write their own Programs; some wish they could but they find the project too daunting!  I hope to show that it is easy to write simple, USEFUL programs.

	I consider that GFA Basic is the most user friendly language, but this is not currently on sale. Fortunately a very similar (but not identical) language has been on a cover disk, and is now available as First Basic, complete with its Manual from Hi Soft, for œ10 only.
	
	Programming is very similar to making things with a child's building blocks. A few simple blocks can make a variety of things, while extra shapes can allow more varied constructions.

	To understand Programming one should understand how the computer puts marks on the screen. Remember that the ST has a choice of three resolutions, High, Medium and  Low; High has 640 pixels across the screen in the 'X' direction, and 400 down the screen in the 'Y' direction. Medium has 640 by 200, while Low has 320 by 200. The Falcon normally allows up to 640 by 480. Programs allow one to put marks where you want; these 'marks' can range from dots to lines, to letters of the Alphabet and Punctuation, and colours can also be selected.

	I am assuming that you are looking at a Medium resolution screen, though I am trying to write the following programs so that the results can be seen at any resolution,including the Falcon at 640x480 on 256 colours, even though proportions will vary.
	If you double click on 1STBASIC.PRG you will get an empty screen, apart from a menu bar at the top of the screen. To write a very short program that puts a single dot on the screen, type the following...

	rem    DOT.BAS    puts a dot on the screen, near top centre.
	pset (200,10)

	Note that rem stands for a REMARK that will not do anything in the program, but can be used by the writer to note down the Filename under  which it will be SAVEd, and any explanation.
	PSET means set a pixel at the X and Y position, in the enclosing brackets.
	
	Press ALT/X, or click on RUN under the Program option at the top of the screen, to Run the program that will display the dot on the screen.  You could either start a new program as shown below, by clicking on NEW under the FILE option, or by adding the second line below, under the pset line in the first program

	rem    LINEF.BAS  puts a line on the screen 
	linef 10,5,10,120        ' puts a vertical line on the screen.

	Note that the REM reminds you of a new Filename if you want to Save this as a separate program, using SAVE AS; however putting an apostrophe   after a program line means that the following text is a Remark. Never put a REM or ' at the end of a Data line, as this will stop the program running.
	  
	Run this program, or the combination of the Dot and Line to see what happens.

	Try making any alterations to the figures in the program lines to see what difference it makes. For example try making the line slope, by typing a second line...

	linef 10,5,100,120         ' makes a sloping line

	Ensure that your master disk is Write Protected; make and use a back up copy. If you want to save any of your altered programs, use SAVE AS to allow you to enter a DIFFERENT filename, but check in the Directory that your new choice does not already exist, so as to avoid overwriting another file. For example, BARCHART.BAS could be SAVED AS BARCHAT2.BAS, or MYBARS.BAS.

  The Computer knows HOW to draw Letters of the Alphabet and punctuation marks on the screen; you have to instruct it WHAT to print, and WHERE to put it. This is done by the PRINT command, for  example...

	LOCATE 2,18
	PRINT "Hello"

	Locate tells the computer WHERE to print; note that DOWN the screen position  is written before the ACROSS position, and is different from the sequence for positioning dots or lines.  The computer uses a grid of 8x8 pixels to form printed character, so each letter will be in the next 8 pixels  block from it's neighbour; this allows 80 characters across a 640 pixel screen.

	Further program lines can be added, for example...

	Locate 5,20
	print 13*19
	print 14/3
	print 15857-6241
	print 134+51

	This still prints the line and Hello on the screen, but now prints the ANSWER to 13 multiplied by 19, giving 247  bellow  Hello, while 14 divided by 3 is shown on the next line down, but in Column 0, as no position has been asked for with a fresh Locate statement.
	As you can now display the answer to calculations, why not write a VAT calculator?

	Rem     VAT.BAS  calculator
	Print  "          VAT at 17.5%"   ' Title; adjust in the editor.
	Print                             ' leaves a blank line
	Print
	INPUT "Sum in œ";S                ' to type in the initial sum                             V=1.175                           ' adjust if needed
	T=S*V                             ' Total will be Sum * Vat factor
	Print  "Extra due to VAT = œ"; T-S
	Print  "Total including VAT = œ";T

	INPUT allows the user to feed in figures, or Text.
	The VARIABLES S,T and V have been used to represent values and answers to calculations. Any letter of the alphabet can be used, or complete words like TOTAL, SALARY, JOHN, etc. make the program clearer to read; however you must not use any of 1st BASIC's reserved words like PRINT, BAR, DATA, etc. 

	Remember that only the correct punctuation marks will allow the program to work properly, if at all! Distinguish between colon and semicolon, or beteen comma and apostrophy, etc.  Problems often occur since Capital I, lower case l, and figure 1 are easily confused.

	Note also that the start and end positions of a Line are all relative to zero at the top left of the screen; however BAR displays a box where the first two co-ordinates locate the  bottom left corner, while the second pair set the Width and Height....

	REM    BAR.BAS  displays a box or frame.
	COLOR 1,1                   ' sets black line colour
	BAR  100,10,40,70

	The sample programs on disk, have on the top line, the FILENAME, some hint of what the program does, also suggested choice of Resolution; many program lines are annotated with Remarks to explain what they do. Only 2 or 3 are suitable for the Falcon only.

	Load these programs, note the required Resolution, and examine the Remarks. Run the program by pressing ALT/X, and see what it does. When it has finished it's run, press a key to get back to the Editor, and re-examine the program lines and Remarks.

	It is very instructive to write your own short programs for each of the Reserved words in the Manual; see p155 for an example of BAR. Note that nothing will be seen on the screen unless you include the COLOR statement to tell the computer what colour to make the BAR.
