GRIDDLE is Griddle by R.A.Waddilove written in HiSoft Basic.  This file
is two programs that run in low rez color (med. too, but the display
isn't as nice).  One program displays a continuous grid of evolving
colors evolving according to the rules of "Life").  The other program
prints out to screen each generation of the grid (a dozen or so per
screen) so you can see how the display evolves.  Source code included.
