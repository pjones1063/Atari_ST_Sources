A2LSWTCH.PRG by Jan Dembowski    

(Thats ARC.TTP TO LHARC.TTP Switcher!)

What you've got
---------------

       In A2LSWTC2.ARC should be A2LSWTC2.PRG (really?) and 
A2LSWTC2.DOC (your reading it!) and A2LSWTC2.BAS (the basic 
listing of the program). This A2LSWTC2.PRG is not copyrighted (how 
do you do that anyway?) but if you pass it around then give me 
credit okay?

What this program does
----------------------

     This program is offered to allow people who use LHARC and ARC 
to switch back and forth between the two compression methods with 
the least amount of effort. A2LSWTC2.PRG is written in HiSoft 
Basic and uses the mouse. I've tried to make this program as user 
friendly as I can, if you get lost in the program just press the 
Cancel button on any of the alert boxes. This will take you back 
to the beginning of the program. At any of the Item Selectors 
pressing cancel will simply get you to the point BEFORE the Item 
Selector was called. If an Item Selector stares you in the face 
and you don't know what it wants just hit Cancel and you'll end up 
at a alert box thats tells you what the Item Selector will be used 
for.

First time you run this
-----------------------

     When A2LSWTC2.PRG is ran it checks if a file called 
A2LSWTCH.CNF is in the same folder as the program. If it is it 
will read three lines out of that file: 1)The name and path of the 
ARC.TTP you are using. Use DCOPY or ARC521B.TTP or what ever you 
want. 2) The name and path of LHARC.TTP. 3) The word "Leave" or 
"Delete". This last line tells A2LSWTC2.PRG if you want to leave 
the original file you've switched alone or delete it. I use this 
program to change whole folders of ARC's to LZH's and then delete 
the originals. They've been switched: what do I need two 
compressed files for anyway? But the default is "Leave". This is 
being safe in case you don't trust the compression programs or my 
switcher (God forbid!).
     If A2LSWTCH.CNF does not exist then the A2LSWTC2.PRG will ask 
you for your defaults, etc. But what if the configuration file 
exist and you decide to change your configuration file? Just run 
A2LSWTC2.PRG only this time press SHIFT or CONTROL or ALTERNATE 
any combination of those keys. This will force A2LSWTC2.PRG to 
make a new configuration file.

Why I wrote this
----------------

     LHARC is awesome. I like to keep ARC'ed copies of my files 
around for backup purposes. Some day I might want that program so 
I just ARC it and put it away for future use. But ARC files take 
up disk space and I'm er, a frugal kind of guy. I don't like 
wasting disk space. LHARC puts ARC to shame. It just compresses 
much better. Period. But converting all of these ARC's to LZH's 
hurts the fingers and eyes. Hurts a lot. So I when I saw 
ARC2LZH2.ARC by Doyle C. Helms I was overjoyed! Happy! Then I 
tried it. It only ran off drive D. You couldn't select where the 
LZH files would end up. I kept messing up the Item Selectors.
     So I got out my HiSoft Basic and made my own converter. Now a 
ARC to LZH converter had been made already so lets call my program 
a "Switcher" okay? Now it does exactly what I want it to do. The 
"Switcher" can be ran ANYWHERE in your file system. I have made it 
so anyone can use it. Run it off drive G if you want. Don't worry 
about putting it in any folder: the program will figure out where 
it is located and adjust.
     The interesting part of the program was the file handling 
part. This was taken from DIR2STR.BAS that comes with HiSoft 
Basic. USE THOSE EXAMPLES! They are very informative and useful. I 
can't say enough how the HiSoft Basic examples made things easier. 
I've read reviews in different places (Atari Explorer was the last 
place) about HiSoft Basic. Its a great basic. I like it a great 
deal: why not try it out? If you program in basic, and were raised 
on basic that was Microsoft Basic compatible then this is for you.
     I've included the basic source code: It has comments 
sprinkled all over it. Its not really very structured and any 
comments are gladly welcome. Thanks to Derrick Hall for his Alert 
Maker program: I made my own alert boxes but his showed me how its 
done.
     Well thats it. I hope you like this program. If you have any 
questions I can be reached on GEnie at J.DEMBOWSKI1 Leave me mail 
and I'll answer it as soon as I get it.

Why I wrote version 1.02 on September 5,1989
--------------------------------------------

     I gave my program a good test today by switching 83 ARC'ed 
files into LZH (3.7 megs). Took an hour or two and showed me a 
few things I missed. When the configuration is read the option for 
deleting the original file after its switched wasn't read thanks 
to a typo. Now it is. When a bad ARC or LZH file is read and 
generates a error, the alert box now tells you what file we were 
working with when the error was made. Somewhere in the 83 files I 
was working with was two bad ARC files. Since the program didn't 
tell me what file it was on... well you get the idea. If the work 
folder existed and had files in it then they were added to the new 
compressed file. Now if the work folder exists the program will 
try ten slightly different work folder names before giving up. The 
last bug was in creating a folder to send the new compressed files 
in. Before the program would let you try to create the root 
directory or an existing folder. I now check if the folder is 
valid before trying to create it. These are the last bugs and I 
don't expect to make any more changes to this program. Just to 
make sure that nothing unexpected comes up I've put in a check to 
see if there is enough memory to run the TTP's.
     There is one thing to watch out for that will occur when 
switching a lot of files. The screen that I use for ARC.TTP and 
LHARC.TTP is really a 33k long string called screen$. Sometimes 
HiSoft's runtimes will do a garbage collection a jar the string a 
byte or two (God I hope thats it! If its not then I have no idea 
what happens!) This will make the old portion of the screen look 
weird and multi colored in medium resolution. Don't worry about it 
the program works fine and the weird part will scroll off the top 
of the screen. To lessen the chance of this I've increased the 
memory that my program keep up to 80k. If this causes any problems 
let me know on GEnie at J.DEMBOWSKI1.
