                        Circle Dividing Program

     This program uses a dot matrix printer to print out a linear scale 
of any desired length graduated and labeled in 360 increments 
representing the degrees in a circle.

     After running the program, it will ask you the length in 
millimeters of the scale desired.  This figure is determined by 
measuring the outside circumference of the cylindrical object the degree 
scale is being created for.

     The minimum scale length this program will handle is 30 
millimeters.  At this length, the program will label the scale every 90 
degrees.

     If the scale is sufficiently long to allow room, the program is 
capable of dividing each degree mark into sixths, and mark the scale at 
intervals of 10 arc minutes.

     Scales of a specific length numbered from 0 to 100 may also be 
created by multiplying the desired length of the scale by 3.6, then 
shutting off the printer when the 100 mark is printed.

     The program is currently set up to print on Epsom MX-series 
compatible printers which have a minimum line pitch of 216th of an inch. 
If the program is to be run through a printer with a different minimum 
line pitch, the source code included in this ARC needs to be modified to 
be compatible with the different printer specifications.  If the line 
pitch specification in the source code is not correct, the program will 
run and print, but the scale length will not match that desired.

     To properly modify the source code to fit a different printer, the 
variable IO=216 at the left of line 16 needs to be changed to reflect 
the specifications for minimum line pitch shown in your printer manual. 

     This program was originally displayed in the March, 1988, Sky and 
Telescope Magazine.  It was written in OMIKRON-Basic 2.0 by Jost Jahn of 
West Germany.  The source code shown in the magazine was compiled with 
HiSoft Basic to create CIRCLDIV.PRG.
