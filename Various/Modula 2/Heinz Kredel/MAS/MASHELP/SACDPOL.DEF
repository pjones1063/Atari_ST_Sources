PROCEDURE DMPPRD(RL,ML,A,B: LIST): LIST;
(*Dense modular polynomial product.  A and B are polynomials in r
variables over Z sub m, m a beta-integer, r ge 0.  C=A*B.*)


PROCEDURE DMPSUM(RL,ML,A,B: LIST): LIST;
(*Dense modular polynomial sum.  A and B are dense polynomials in r
variables over Z sub m, m a beta-integer.  C=A+B.*)


PROCEDURE DMUPNR(PL,A,B: LIST): LIST;
(*Dense modular univariate polynomial natural remainder.  A and B are
non-zero dense univariate polynomials over Z sub p, p a prime
beta-integer, with deg(A) ge deg(B).  C is the natural remainder of B.
The list for A is modified.*)
