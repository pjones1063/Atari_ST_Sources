(*Universal read. The next atom, symbol, string or list over atoms, 
strings and symbols is read and stored under L. Blanks may occur 
anywhere. Elements of a list may or may not be separated by a comma.*)

atoms and symbols. L is written in the output stream,
followed by blines. *)

(*Unification. A and B are objects. If there exists a 
most general unificator of A and B, then S is the list of 
substitutions. In this case TRUE is returned. If no unificator
exists, then FALSE is returned and S is undefined. *)
