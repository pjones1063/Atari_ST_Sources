things to do, perhaps anyone will help:

- complete GEMAES.DEF and GEMVDI.DEF

- complete crys_usc.m2h

- keyboard resources for other countries and for PC-DOS
  (remember, there are no XBIOS functions for PC-DOS, FlexOS and so on)

- ApplTool.FrameCode() for PCDOS

- FSelTool

- ShelTool

- ScrpTool

- FlyingLook: ObjcEdit for SMALL, listboxes, flying alerts are still missing

- multiple resources, colored icons for all versions of GEM
  (s. Interface-RCS)

- non-modal forms (dialogs)
