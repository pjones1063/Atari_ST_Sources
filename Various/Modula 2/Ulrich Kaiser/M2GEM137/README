(This is readme to the archive m2gem???.lzh)

"crystal" is an attempt of a high-portable GEM-library for GEM and
Modula-2 systems under PC-DOS (with PC-GEM), GEMDOS (with ATARI-GEM),
FlexOS (with X/GEM) and UNIX (with X/GemOnX).

The work is already done for quite a lot of PC-DOS- and GEMDOS-systems.

Because of the differences between PIM2-, PIM3-, PIM4-, ETH- and ISO-
compilers, the SYSTEM module and other system-dependend features, the
sources are expanded by GNU-C-preprocessor macros. The preprocessor is
handled by the MUPFEL/GEMINI shareware shell or another shell.

crystal is freeware. It comes without any warranty. You use it by your
own risk.

The GNU-C-preprocessor is to be found at any anonymous ftp area (e.g.
atari.archive.umich.edu)

A few number of sources uses POSIX calls from the archive M2POSX*.ZOO
which may be found at ftp.atari.archive.umich.edu (directory programming)
or ftp.uni-kl.de or ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de.

Short instructions are in short.txt (english), kurz.txt (german) or
court.txt (french). More documentation is in crystal.tex - an ASCII file,
which may also be read by non-TeX-users. Read the short instructions or
you will be very confused!
