For  HM2  there  is an archive named hm2gm???.lzh (??? is a version number)
which  contains  the  already  pre-processed  files.  You  should find this
archive at the same location where you found this archive.

The  following  strings have to be patched within the compiler (hm2.acc) by
means of a file monitor:

VOID, e.g. by Void (conflict with module INTRINSIC)
BYTESET, e.g. by ByteSet (conflict with module PORTAB)
LONGSET, e.g. by LongSet (conflict with module PORTAB)

With  crystal  you need not HM2's AES.LIB. But there will arise no conflict
if  you install AES.LIB. Making a program written with crystal the compiler
will  ask  you  which  is  the  right path to crystal's AES.B: ...\AES.B or
...\AES.LIB.
