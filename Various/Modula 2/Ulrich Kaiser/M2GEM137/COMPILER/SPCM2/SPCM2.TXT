For  SPCM2 there is an archive named spcgm???.lzh (??? is a version number)
which  contains  the  already  pre-processed  files.  You  should find this
archive at the same location where you found this archive.

Because  of the hierarchy of the modules and some circular imports you have
to  compile  the  included  files  make_1st.cmd..make_6th.cmd  just in that
order which their names suggest.
