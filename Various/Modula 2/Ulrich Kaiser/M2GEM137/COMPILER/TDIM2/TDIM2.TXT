For  TDI  there  is an archive named tdigm???.lzh (??? is a version number)
which  contains  the  already  pre-processed  files.  You  should find this
archive at the same location where you found this archive.

The directory PD contains among some other things a description of bugs in
TDI's GEMX.MOD.

Fortunatly  there  is  a  modified  GEMX.MOD by R.S., which eliminates many
bugs. If you are interested, you will write to me:

Ulrich Kaiser
KÅhlenbergstr. 34
D-97078 WÅrzburg

Germany

I shall pass then your request to R.S.

The only module that is needed from the TDI-Modula distribution is the
module Storage.
