Company Profile



ana-systems specializes in software tools and consulting services. The company
was founded in 1980.

Currently there are two lines of products sold. Both lines are available on
many of the popular workstations and Unix systems.

One product line is Modula-2. Two primary products being sold are based on our
Modula-2 language system technology. They are a host based Modula-2
programming language system and a Modula-2 cross development product on VAX
systems. The cross development product is used to make applications for
embedded systems using Motorola's MC68000 family of microprocessors.

The other product line is Documenter's Workbench (DWB). This is an electronic
publishing tool set developed by AT&T. The DWB tools are considered a standard
part of the Unix system. DWB is one of three popular "batch" electronic
publishing systems in wide use on Unix based systems.

In addition to producing software products for sale, the company provides
technical services to its customers on a time and materials basis. These
services include consulting and contract development for product
specification, design, development, testing, documentation, and training.

Products and services are sold directly in the USA. In Europe products are
sold through Real Time Associates, Ltd. our representatives in the United
Kingdom. Advertising for the Modula-2 products appears regularly in a widely
read Unix magazine. Marketing literature and advertisements are produced using
the Documenter's Workbench tool set.

Engineering at ana-systems emphasizes the production of easy to install, high
quality, products. Products are thoroughly tested before being released.
Whenever possible the testing process is automated so frequent retesting and
continual improvement of test procedures are possible. Careful attention
is made to maintain a development environment that supports improvements to
existing products using the minimum of additional work and the development of
products that can be easily adapted to new host operating systems. All
technical documentation is produced using tools from the Documenter's
Workbench tool set.

The goal for the Modula-2 product line is to give software designers the
option of using Modula-2 for all programming applications. The goal for the
DWB product line is to make useful enhancements to DWB and to provide a well
integrated electronic publishing tool. Products in both product lines
are being improved. Ideas for new products and product lines are regularly
evaluated.
