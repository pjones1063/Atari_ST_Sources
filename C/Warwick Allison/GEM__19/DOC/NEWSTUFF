NEW TO GEM++ 2.0 SINCE GEM++ 1.8:

- GEMcanvas virtual VDI display area object.
- GEMfont and GEMfontlist font support.
- Object() method in GEMform for tidier own-objects reference.
- Scrolling objects and optimized window scrolling.
- G++ 2.5.3 compatible.
- Bug fixes (esp. window problems of 1.8)
- LaTeX documentation *** NOT IN VERSION 1.99 ***

NEW TO GEM++ 1.8 SINCE GEM++ 1.7:

- Supports WINX "send window to background" extension.
- Supports MTOS/WINX "click on backgrounded windows" extension.
- GEMwindow and GEMslider now use GEMpanarea as a common base class.
- 1.7 slider bug fixed.

NEW TO GEM++ 1.7 SINCE GEM++ 1.5:

- Flying dialog boxes (both opaque and transparent) (thanks Markus Gutschke)
- GEMactivity::OneDo(int eventmask) - for more powerful event handling
- Hotforms passe more unprocessed keys to DoKey() (esp. arrow keys).
- ForeCol(), BackCol(), BorderCol(), FillPattern() etc methods for GEMobject.
- SetText() and other GEMobject methods debugged.
- GEMobject::SetWidth/SetHeight, "rubberness" added to GEMformwindow.
      (this allows self-resizing objects)
- Window colour (TOS >= 2.0) now supported.  Thanks Waldi of Nederland!
- Automatic delay on sliders (still needs work - user configurability)
- Conform to further changes to VDI bindings.
- Slider increments and timer delays are user configurable.
- Window slider increments are user configurable.
- Example program updated to demonstrate Flying and Window Colours.
- Bug fixes.  Expecially GEMobject attributes (Text(), etc).

(Again, many of the improvement resulted from writing GEM NetHack)
