  This version is a stop-gap.  Due to problems with v.1.8, and because of
  AEO-PJ #3, I have released this early version of GEM++ 2.0.  The main
  component missing from this early version is the documentation for the
  new classes.

  Note that the makefiles are now configured for optimized compilation.
  This greatly reduces the size of the library and executables.  It also
  takes longer, and uses a LOT more memory, so on a 4M machines, you may
  have to turn it off.

  Requires the GNU C++ compiler. (available everywhere!)

  Requires Bammi's GEMLIB patchlevel 30 or better. (available everywhere!)
        or MiNTLIBS patchlevel 34 or better.

  Developed with GNU C++ 2.5.3 and MiNTLIBS.

  Try the ORCS resource editor (can you find a version after 1.00?).
