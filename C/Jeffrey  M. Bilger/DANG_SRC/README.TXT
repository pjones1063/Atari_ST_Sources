

 Dangimere RPG source files. 
 --------------------------

 This archive contains all the  'C' source files plus the 
 assembler source for the TSR digitized sound player.
 
 All the C code was written using Megamax Laser C and I 
 have included two .LNK files :

            A.LNK ----> will link all the modules and produce 
                        a file called CITY( the main program)
       RUN_ME.LNK ----> will link some modules to create the 
                        file  RUNME.PRG( the boot program which
                        will call CITY)

  The game will not run without all the .DAT files and all the
 other files that are included in the GAME archive. 



               Good luck.
