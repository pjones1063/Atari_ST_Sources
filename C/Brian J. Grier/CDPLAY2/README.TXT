This program allows you to play CD's with audio tracks
on your Chinon 431. The program will locate the drive
on your system. If no drive is found the program will
just exit, with no message. This program has been designed
to work like most portable CD players so no instructions
should be required. When you exit the program the current
song will play to completion.

This latest version has some minor improvements. No longer
will you get a strange display when attempting to play a disc
that does not have any audio tracks.

This time source code is included for those of you interested
in exactly how this program works. This archive contains almost
everything you will need to compile and link this program under
either Pure C or Turbo C for the STe/TT. You will need to get 
the file 'dma.o' from the ICD area, in the 'dma.lzh' archive. 
This file should be placed in either the project directory, or 
the directory that contains your libraries.

I am not including the file 'dma.o' since I did not create it, 
and do not have ICD's permission to distribute it.

System requirements:
     1) Atari ST/STe/TT (Have not tried on a Falcon)
     2) Chinon 431 CD-Rom drive
     3) ICD Host Adapter (not required for TT SCSI port)
     4) ICD Host Adapter software (At least version 6.0)
     5) Pure C or Turbo C for the STe/TT
