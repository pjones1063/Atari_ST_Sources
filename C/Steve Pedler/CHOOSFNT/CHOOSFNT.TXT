CHOOSFNT.PRG

This is a simple font chooser, allowing you to choose from a list of GDOS 
font names. It works, but could certainly stand some improvement. For 
example, the scrolling doesn't use blitting so is a little flickery.

You can click on a name to highlight it, then on OK to return the selected 
name, or double-click on a name to return without needing to click OK. 
Click the name again to remove the selection, or on Cancel to abort the 
selection. Note that your selected font name is retained even if it 
scrolls off the available display area.

I have included the source code plus resource file for anyone interested. 
I don't pretend that the code is perfect! I extracted it very quickly from 
a larger program so it won't be as clean as it could be.

Feel free to modify and use as you wish. This dialog could be modified to 
allow you to choose from any list of strings - you're not restricted to 
font names.
