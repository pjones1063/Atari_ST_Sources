PS2TXT.TTP

I compiled this program with the GNU C 1.40 compiler on my Atari ST.
This program is only usefull when you're using a shell, because the output
is always sent to standard output. When you start the program from the
desktop the output is displayed on the screen, but you can't redirect it
to a file.
