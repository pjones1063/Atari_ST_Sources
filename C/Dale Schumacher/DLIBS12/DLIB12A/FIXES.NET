The following uuencoded archive contains fixes to nearly all reported
bugs in dLibs v1.2.  It's only about 22K, so I thought it would be
reasonable to post it directly.  A "readme" file in the archive explains
what bugs are fixed.  This is intended to be a interrum fix.  A 1.3
version of dLibs, including these fixes and probably other additions,
will be released with the next release of Sozobon C (hopefully in a
few months).
