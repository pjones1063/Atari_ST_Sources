                VA-PROTOCOL Support Functions

 The functions in vafunc.c support the calling and receiving of the 
 VA-Protocol messages that Gemini and Ease etc support.
 Also I have added a couple of functions for calling ST-Guide and 
 1STGuide.

 Unfortunately, I have not had time to translate the German comments, if 
 anyone has problems implementing VA support with these functions then 
 contact me (mdavidsona@cix) and I will try to help. NB My German is 
 mainly guesswork, so a translation from me may never happen :-(

 I have sucessfully used several of these functions within my own 
 programs, so they do work :-)

 Have fun.
