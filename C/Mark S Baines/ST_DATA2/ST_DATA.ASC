           An extensive update of ST_TYPE.TOS, a program which gives
            details on the type of ST and its configuration setup.

Introduction
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Atari, in their wisdom, have created a situation where there are many different 
types of STs in people's homes and offices. What have we got?

There are 4 different operating systems (TOS), 1.0 (ROM TOS), 1.2 (Blitter 
TOS), 1.4x (Rainbow TOS), 1.6x (STE TOS). TOS 2 on MegaSTEs soon and TOS 030 on 
TTs.

There are 2 versions of GEMDOS, 0.19 (TOS 1.0 and 1.2), 0.21 (TOS 1.4) and 
0.23 (TOS 1.6). 

There are 2 versions of the AES, 1.20 (TOS 1.0 and 1.2) and 1.40 (TOS 1.4 and 
1.6). 

There are 2 versions of GDOS though you should only use Release 1.1. 

There are 15 different nationalities of ROM.

STs either have a Blitter chip fitted or not.

There are 3 different resolutions and many different amounts of RAM memory from 
256 K to 4 Mb.  I'll leave it to you to work out all the different 
combinations.

All this can create problems for software developers and subsequent 'bug' 
troubleshooters.  If you ring up or write to your software company for some 
technical advice, reporting a bug or undocumented 'feature', it is of great 
help to them to know what system the program is running on.  HiSoft provide a 
program called CHECKST.PRG which provides them with this information but it is 
not Public Domain.  I have therefore written this program which does the same 
thing for all you non-HiSoft software users!

The program
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
ST_DATA2.TOS will print the details to screen, or optionally the printer (not a 
screen dump), of the TOS and ROM details, some hardware details such as disk 
drives installed and system variable and software configurations. A list if the 
details provided is:

Hardware Details:
TOS Version
ROM Date
GEMDOS Version
AES Version
ROM Nationality
Monitor Attached
RAM Memory
Blitter Chip Present
Drives Mounted (including all partitions and RAM disks)
Boot Drive
Number of Floppy Disk Drives
System Date and Time

System Variables and Configuration Details:
Base of Operating System
End of Operating System
Start of Transient Program Area (TPA)
End of TPA
End of RAM
Start of AES
Physbase (base of current screen display)
Logbase (base of current drawing area)
GDOS Installed
Disk Verify Status
Floppy Drive Seekrate
Key Delay Rate
Key Repeat Rate
Key Click Status
Alarm Bell Status

Using It:
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
The program is double-clicked on from the desktop to run.  It will run on all 
STs and in all resolutions but be untidy in low resolution.  The printer option 
may be useful here or switch to medium rez!  (How any one can use low rez other 
than for games beats me!).

The output consists of 2 screens which can be toggled between with the SPACE 
key.  On the second screen you are given the option to print all the details on 
both screens to a printer attached to the parallel port.  The program will then 
quit automatically.  The RETURN key will also exit to the desktop on this 
screen.

Comments:
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
I have tried to write this program so that it is machine independent using only 
documented system variables and not direct 'peeking' of addresses which have 
and will change between ROM versions.  It should give the correct results on 
all ROM versions therefore, but I can't promise anything as I only have a 
MegaST4 with TOS 1.4 to test it on.  Feedback from 'Floppyshop ST' on a 
previous version of this program (ST_TYPE.TOS) showed that it was accurate.
(oops! see below...)

I hope the program will be of use to you and provide you with the details yo 
seek.

Correction:
Since TOS 1.62 came out I found a simple error that caused the TOS version to 
print out in decimal rather than the correct Hex. Those of you getting TOS 1.98 
with previous versions have TOS 1.62 I'm afraid!
Sorry about that, it should be fixed in this version.
