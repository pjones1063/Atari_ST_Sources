- c_window.h defines a function called WidgetCallback,
  taking a struct window and a struct xa_widget as parameters.
  Unfortunately, those structs are not defined at that time and I
  therefore defined them at the top of the file.
  Later those structs are defined and typedef:ed to XA_WINDOW and XA_WIDGET,
  which are the parameter types that are then sent in:
   c_window.c, evnt_mes.c, evnt_mul.c

  This is not good, but may work.

- The function wind_find in c_window.c/h overlaps the normal GEM function.
  I #defined a name change: _fix_wind_find

- The function graf_mouse in graf_mou.c/h overlaps the normal GEM function.
  I #defined a name change: _fix_graf_mouse

- The contents of cross.c are not used anywhere?!
  The original definition was absurd as well.

- The colour_word (k_defs.h at line 311) should be unsigned.
  Otherwise we have a three bit value == 7 problem in objects.c
