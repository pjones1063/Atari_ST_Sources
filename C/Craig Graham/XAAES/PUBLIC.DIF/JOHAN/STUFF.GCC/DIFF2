From Johan....

As I mentioned earlier, the file XA_TYPES.H gave a lot of warnings.
To get rid of those, do as follows:

Add the two lines below somewhere before the definition of XA_CLIENT,
for example just above the '//Main client...' line.

struct xa_window;
struct xa_widget;

Change the WidgetCallback definition to:

typedef short (*WidgetCallback)(struct xa_window *wind, struct xa_widget *widg);

--
In the file BOOTUP.C, a header file called <FILESYS.H> is included.
That file does not exist among the MiNT lib includes or Lattice's own.
There is such a file in the XaAES source directory, however, so change
the directive to:

#include "filesys.h"

Unfortunately, that's not the only problem with that file. It also defines
some of the same things as <IOCTL.H>, which is included from BOOTUP.C
as well. Fortunately, it turns out that IOCTL.H is not necessary at all
and that include directive can be removed.
