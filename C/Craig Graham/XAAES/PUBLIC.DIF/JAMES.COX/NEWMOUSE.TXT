Well, here it is - a mouse server replacement that is non-blocking. This means
that XaAES will now have absolutely no parts running all of the time, code is
only run when necessery :)

This mouse server will now show the true speed of XaAES and I think you will
be rather impressed - I certainly was.

The uuencode below is an LZH archive with 2 files in it:

  MOUSESRV.S      the assembly (Devpac) source code
  MOUSESRV.TOS    the binary assembled for 68000

Just rename your mousesrv.tos file to something else (in case it doesn't work)
and copy the replacement over.

Really, the mouse server should be integrated into XaAES, although it would
take a bit of work.

Unfortunately, I am going to be seperated from my computer and internet access
until April 22nd, so please don't mail me with questions/problems coz I can't
hear you.

Cheers,
