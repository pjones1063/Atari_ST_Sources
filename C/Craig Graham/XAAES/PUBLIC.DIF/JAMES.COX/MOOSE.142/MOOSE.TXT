*** Moose Server 1.4 ******************************************************

In the course of two days I changed my mind three times as to the best
architecture for this bloody thing... This time, I think I've got it
about right :)

This version of the Moose server is now entirely contained withing an XDD
file, that is, you drop the file MOOSE.XDD inside your MiNT folder on your
boot drive. Unfortunately, XaAES won't be able to o anything with it (yet)
since it extects the mouse buttons data to come from a process called
mousesrv. So, there is a small program that simply acts as an interface
to allow XaAES to read from the moose device.

The modification to make XaAES read data directly from the moose device
should be really simple and take a couple of minutes for someone to do.

The mousesrv process can be killed any which way you like, although it
should be done by sending SIGTERM to it which will make it terminate
nicely. The mousesrv process doesn't patch into anything so there
shouldn't be any problems with killing it and reloading it as with the
last version.

If there are any problems - particularly with dumping XaAES and reloading
it again, please get in touch and I will try to do something about it.


** I've just tried it with XaAES beta 4 ***********************************

Everything worked perfectly... Until I tried to shutdown XaAES and restart
it whereupon the mouse buttons stopped working. Guess what is responsible?
The bloody VDI. You see, if you open/close a physical workstation to the
screen (as XaAES does) the VDI reinstalls its own IKBD mouse handler,
overwriting the entry the Moose device puts in. The Moose device still
though it was installed.

This has been fixed as of version 1.4.2. I have tested it by killing off
XaAES and reloading from a shell about half a dozen times with no problems
at all. I even played around with killing and relaunching the mousesrv
process while XaAES was still running and it still works.

Hurrah!!
 

** Technical stuff ********************************************************

The Moose device works by patching into the IKBD. This is done when it
is told to (presently by mousesrv, but eventually by XaAES). Once it is
patched in, it will never remove itself.

It also installs a timer routine to execute on the vertical blank
interrupt. Most of the time, this interrupt does nothing - only when you
click a mouse button with this routine do anything useful.

The timer routine is installed when a process opens a channel to it, and
is de-installed when that channel is closed (only one process may open
a channel to the Moose device at a time). This system _should_ be safe - I
have used this system for some time now and have never encountered any
problems (yet :).

Lastly, the format of the data sent to the process listening for mouse
button events (XaAES) should really changed. It present, only mouse button
information can be sent. In order to let the Moose help out with mouse
rectangle events, we are going to need a system to differentiate between
button events and rectangle events.
