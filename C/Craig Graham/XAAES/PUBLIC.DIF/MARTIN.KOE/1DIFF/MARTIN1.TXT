Here's another little patch (relative to XaAES beta2):

bootup.c:
   Remove Semaphores in Cleanup().
   Print an error message and call Cleanup() & exit when opening of
   KBD_device failed.
   Ditto when LoadResources("system.rsc") failed.
   (The latter would have saved me two to three hours of bug-hunting
   yesterday...)
resource.c:
   Removed auto-freeing of existing resource in rsrc_load handler;
   under GEM AES, programs *can* have multiple resources.
   (This function still needs some more work - in particular,
   resource memory should *always* be owned by the APP!)
xa_aes.prj (separate file):
   Removed all local compiler options - apparently they had just
   accumulated over time and served no practical purpose...
   (problem of of the Lattice IDE)
Others:
   Lots and lots of added #includes; XaAES should now compile without
   any warnings even with `Enforce function prototypes' enabled - this
   should make porting XaAES to other compilers (or changing the `int'
   size, or changing the parameter passing conventions) somewhat
   easier...
