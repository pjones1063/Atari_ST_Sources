Here's Martin Koehling's list of mods relative to XaAES beta 1. The diffs are applyed
in XaAES beta 2, but I've included his list here:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first take on hacking XaAES; a context diff (relative to
the beta1 release) is appended to this message.

Summary of changes (I hope I didn't forget anything):

a_handler.s:
        Modified the TRAP2 handler to use the XBRA protocol (no
        more self modifying code, too).
a_handler.s:
        BUGFIX: TRAP2 handler now saves *all* modified registers (AFAIK,
        GEM AES does the same, and some APPs/TSRs rely on this [undocumented]
        behaviour)
handler.c:
        Modified hook_into_vector to use Setexc() instead of directly
        hacking the exception vector table; patch_handler() is no longer
        needed. New function unhook_from_vector().
handler.c:
        Added __saveds keyword to XA_handler(), thus eliminating the need
        for `far' data.
appl_init.c:
        Removed a few `far' keywords.
resource.c:
        BUGFIX: improved obfix() to be more GEM AES compatible (fractional
        offsets, ob_width==80 special case).
std_widg.c:
        BUGFIX: wind->widgets[XAW_MENU].w wasn't initialized at all.
        NOTE: there seems to be still another missing-initialization bug
        lurking somewhere - when the FASTLOAD bit is *set*, xaaes.tos
        sometimes simply hangs when I start it from the desktop; this
        does *not* happen when xaaes.tos was started from mint.cnf
        (->clean memory) or when the FASTLOAD bit is *cleared*...
bootup.c:
        If there are less than 16 colors (or was that `colours'? ;-)) available
        (like on my monochrome monitor), initialize display.dial_colours
        differently; the display is still terribly ugly, but at least now
        I can *see* something besides black text on black ground... :-)
bootup.c:
        BUGFIX: use vqt_attributes() (instead of vqt_extend()) to initialize
        display.c_max_w/display.c_max_h - this yields the correct values
        8 and 16 for the `monochrome' system font.
bootup.c:
        BUGFIX: use obfix() in SYSTEM_MENU initialization; don't forget
        SYSTEM_MENU[16] :-).
bootup.c:
        Use a different method for AUTO folder detection: after an
        appl_init() call, check if global[0] (AES version) is still
        zero - this indicates that no AES is present...
        (This method has been documented and successfully used for
        years, and it's inituitively "cleaner" than the original one; in
        addition, it obviates the need for the isauto.s module.)
        (appl_init() should have been called anyway since graf_handle()
        is called later...)
bootup.c:
        New function `Cleanup()' that closes workstations, restores
        the TRAP vector, calls appl_exit()...
        Still quite incomplete (and currently unused anyway).
Others:
        Some changes to header files to reflect the above modifications.
        Added `#include <memory.h>' to a few modules to get rid of `No
        prototype declared for function' warning (some are still missing).
