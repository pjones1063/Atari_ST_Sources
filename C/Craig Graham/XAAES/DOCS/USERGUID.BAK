XaAES User Manual

1) INSTALLATION
-------------------

Installing is pretty easy, just do the following:

i) Stick these files all in one directroy:
   xaaes.tos   - The kernal (colour & mono versions are in seperate archives)
   xaaes.cnf   - Like GEM.CNF, but for xaaes.
   mousserv.tos   - the mouse handler
   logo.prg - the XaAES logo, (possibly) launched at startup.
   system.rsc  - various GUI elements for the kernal (default menu, alert template, etc)
   sys\toswin_w.tos  - The usual toswin console.
   sys\TOSWIN.RSC    - resource file for the above.
   sys\rt.tos  - runtos

ii) If you want a console shell (the xaaes.cnf file is set up to give you one),
   you should edit the xaaes.cnf file so rt runs your fave shell (I use sh, but
   mupfel, etc will work as well).

iii) Add these lines to your MiNT.CNF file:

      cd u:\<path>
      INIT=u:\<path>\xaaes.tos

     Alternatively, if you are a bit more of a techie, XaAES will run happily from
     a command line (and let you exit back to it) or as a login shell.

Ok, thats it.

1.1) COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

XaAES only has one command line switch, which sets the video mode for falcon users:

         -video <mode>

where <mode> is:

      0 = 80 column, non-interlace, mono
      1 = 80 column, non-interlace, 4 colour
      2 = 80 column, non-interlace, 16 colour
      3 = 80 column, non-interlace, 256 colour

These don't work very well at the moment, but do get round the NVDI2.5 problem.
If you are using NVDI on a falcon, and you get a black screen on starup, try
starting XaAES with the '-video 2' as a parameter (this should sort you out).

NOTE: If you are using an ST with a colour monitor/TV, holding down either shift
key whilst XaAES loads will select medium rez instead of low.

2) Using XaAES
-----------------

2.1) Menus

Generally XaAES is like GEM, but with a few exceptions. Most notably, menu's are
Mac-style pull down, not GEM style drop down. This means that you've got to click
on a menu title to see the menu, not just point at it.

2.2) Typing

XaAES is point-to-type - so keyboard input goes to the window under the mouse and
NOT to the top window. (This depends on compile time flags - check the boot message
to see if this feature is active).


3) XaAES Keyboard Combo's
----------------------------

There are a couple of keyboard combo's that XaAES uses for itself. These are:

CTRL+ALT+TAB     : swaps menu bars, not top windows.
CTRL+ALT+L       : Output a list of current client programs to the debug file
CTRL+ALT+D       : Output a status dump to the debug file
CTRL+ALT+K       : Clean up - search for dead clients that didn't call appl_exit
CTRL+ALT+R       : Attempt to recover control of a hung system - use as a last resort,
                   as this will kill the clients that are blocking the system.

NOTE: CTRL+ALT+L & CTRL+ALT+D only output anything if GENERATE_DIAGS was turned on at
compile time - in the binary distributions released by me (Craig) they will have no
effect as all diagnostics are turned off.

4) SYSTEM MENU
---------------

The XaAES system menu (CTRL+ALT+TAB until you get it) currently contains two useful
options.

One is the 'About XaAES...' option which (surprisingly) brings up a nice
little descriptive box.

The other (more useful) option is in 'Shutdown'. This will kill all GEM programs
and exit XaAES gracefully. Unlike MultiTOS, if you ran XaAES from a command line
or as a login shell, you will be returned to the command line or login prompt. You
can then re-start XaAES, or do whatever - XaAES can be exitted and restarted as many
times as you like without rebooting the machine.

XaAES catches CTRL+ALT+C and CTRL+ALT+\  (SIGINT & SIGQUIT respectively) and executes
the shutdown procedure in response to them, so you should be able to get back to your
command line in most situations.

5) THE xaaes.cnf FILE
-----------------------

This is a bit like MultiTOS's GEM.CNF file. It's main purpose is to let you auto-launch
programs as XaAES starts up. Generally the syntax of this is supposed to be the same as
Atari's GEM.CNF file

It's a simple text file with the following format:

i)   '#' is a comment line.
ii)  Commands are not case sensitive (although paths may be, depending on your filesystem).
iii) If a command isn't understood, it gets ignored...
iv)  These commands are currently supported:

         run <program> <parameters....>
            Launch a program.

         debug <file/device>
            Set debugging output to <file/device> (default is .\debug.list)

         clipboard <directory>
            Set the GEM clipboard to be in <directory> (default is c:\clipbrd).

And example xaaes.cnf file (in fact, the one I use) is:

   #Craig's Setup
   #---------------
   # Set the default clipboard path
   clipboard c:\clipbrd\
   #
   # Launch toswin (68030 version) to handle TOS programs for me
   run u:\h\sources\aes\sys\toswin30.prg
   #
   # Launch the desktop
   run u:\c\thing\thing.app
   #
   # Set Debugging to go to serial port
   debug u:\dev\ttyb
   #

x) Caveats
--------------

I've compiled  out most of the diagnostics, but if you get funny messages on
the screen, add the line 'debug \dev\null' to the xaaes.cnf file.

Loads of stuff is missing at the moment, don't hassle me - fix it and get back
to me.
