OK folks - XaAES beta 5 is upon us....

New stuff in this beta includes:

o Mouse server finally becomes a device in this release - courtesy of James Cox's
  wonderful new all assembler mouse handling code. This gives much better double
  click detection, and also removes some busy waiting (giving a slight speed up).

Outstanding GEM compatibility issues:
o 'Live' window operations.
o Accessory support.
o File selector - major problem, gotta sort that out as first priority.
o Better mono support.

Other outstanding issues:
o Window Manager API. As discussed on the XaAES mailling list, the
  underlying stuff is already in place to allow alternative window
  managers to load after XaAES. What should the API be like?
o Docked toolbars - they're cool, and the widget structure of XaAES
  would make them dead easy to do.
o Getting round to putting in Johan's GCC diffs (oops, missed them again - next time,
  I promise).

If anyone fancies doing a re-build with sockets instead of pipes, I'd
love to see it.

Craig Graham.
