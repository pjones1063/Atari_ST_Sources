NAME

	cc68x - a simple c68 compiler driver

SYNOPSIS

	cc68x [options] file [file ..]

DESCRIPTION

	>>> This document isn't finished yet <<<

OPTIONS

	-c		Compile, but don't link.

	-D<name[=val]>	Define preprocessor symbol <name>.

	-E		Preprocess to stdout.

	-f		Link with libm.a and  make sure that the floating
			point versions of printf and scanf are being used.

	-g		Compile for use with debugger.

	-I<path>	Add <path> to header file search list.

	-l<name>	Link with the library <name>.  See below for
			naming conventions.

	-n		Like -v, but don't really do anything.

	-N<X>=<prog>	The program <prog> will be executed to perform
			the specified compilation phase instead of the
			default program.  <X> can be one of:

				P -- preprocessing phase
				C -- code generation phase
				A -- assembly phase
				L -- linking phase

	-o <file>	Name the output file.

	-O		Enable full optimization.

	-p		Compile with profiling code.  This option is not
			yet supported.

	-P		Preprocess, but don't compile.

	-S		Compile, but don't assemble.

	-t		Don't remove temporary files.

	-U<name>	Undefine preprocessor symbol <name>.

	-v		Verbose mode, cc68x shows what it's doing  (-v -v
			will show additional version information about
			the various passes).

	-W<n>		Set c68's warning level to <n>.  Legal values
			range from 0 to 7, with higher values giving
			pickier warnings.  -W3 is the default.

	-ansi		Set c68 and cpp for ANSI or K&R mode, respectively.
	-trad		Default is -ansi.

	-mshort		Selects integer size.  -mshort is the default, and
	-mlong		sets sizeof(int) == 2; -mlong sets sizeof(int) == 4.
			Note that when -mlong is in effect, the names of the
			system libraries and libraries include with -l are
			suffixed with '32' (ie. `-lfred' ==> libfred32.a).

	+<X><opt>	The option <opt> is passed directly to the
			compilation phase specified by <X>.  <X> can be one
			of:

				P -- preprocessing phase
				C -- code generation phase
				A -- assembly phase
				L -- linking phase

LIBRARIES

	cc68x recognizes two library naming schemes:  Unix-style and
	TOS-style.  When the option `-lfred' is given, cc68x searches
	the directories listed in the environment variable $C68LIB for
	the Unix-style translation of the option, and then searches them
	for the TOS-style translation.  The exact translation depends on
	the presence of the -mshort or -mlong option:

			Unix style	TOS style

	with -mshort	libfred.a	fred.lib
	with -mlong	libfred32.a	fred.l32

	Note that the Unix-style name can exceed the filename length
	restrictions of the TOS file system, especially with -mlong;
	if you are using a non-MiNT-aware linker, you may want to
	use TOS-style library names to avoid filename collision.

FILES

	cc68x recognizes the following file name extensions:

	.c	C source

	.cpp	Assembler source with preprocessor directives
	.spp

	.i	Preprocessed C source

	.s	Assembler source

	All other files are treated as object files or libraries
	and passed to the linker.

ENVIRONMENT

	$C68INC		list of search paths for header files
	$C68LIB		path for standard library (no list!)
