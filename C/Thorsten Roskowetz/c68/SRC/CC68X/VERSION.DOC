Version notes for cc68x (these are more notes to myself than anything
that should be taken as gospel, BTW -- sb).

10/4/94	  - Internal version 0.0.1.
	  - Added TOS-friendly optional names for libraries.  -lfred will
	    now find either of libfred.a or fred.lib with -mshort, or
	    either of libfred32.a or fred.l32 with -mlong.

12/4/94   - Added -N option to specify a different program for one of
	    the translation phases.
	  - Change the default assembler name to "as68" to accommodate
	    c68 v4.5.1.
	  - Added a check for no filename arguments.
	  - Version 0.0.2 released.
