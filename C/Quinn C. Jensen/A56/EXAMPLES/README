DSP56001 code examples -

These code samples are fragments that run at interrupt time to generate
the next sample.  Additional code is required to set up the processor
and hardware based on the specific configuration.  A portion of my runtime
environment is illustrated in tdsg.basic.a56, which is included by most
of the examples.  It is assumed that external 0-wait-state RAM exists in
all spaces, and that a stereo A/D and DAC are hooked up to the SSI ports,
in alternating L/R format.

Some of the code is based on stuff from the Motorola Dr. Bubb BBS and
Todd Day's archives.

The Makefile processes .a56 files by first running them through cpp.
The resulting .omf files are suitable for downloading by sloader.a56.

On my hardware, the MSG macro, and the disp subroutine output stuff to a
two-digit hex display.  

For more information on the stereo effects examples (chorus.a56, flange.a56,
and reverb.a56) see README.effects.
