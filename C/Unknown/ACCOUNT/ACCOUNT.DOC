     This program was written with LASER 'C' from Megamx inc.
     
     This  program was my first attempt at a  GEM  program,  after 
     many  hours  at the keyboard this is the  result.  The  first 
     versions  were written with Megamax and the final version  in 
     LASER  'C',  which  for  the interested is  a  much  improved 
     version of Megamax,the parts that caused me the problems with 
     Gem seem to have been cured or explained better in the doc.s

     The program consists of two parts ACCOUNT.PRG and ACCOUNT.RSC 
     both of these must be present on the disc for the program  to 
     run,  the  program will create three more files if these  are 
     not present on the disc ie.  FILE1,FILE2,FILE3 these are used 
     to hold the account information.

     The  program will run much better with a R.T.C  installed  in 
     your  ST,  or you must set the date correctly before  running 
     this program as when the program is run it will automatically 
     remove from its copy of your account your standing orders  at 
     the date (day only) that you have selected.

          PLEASE NOTE THE PASSWORD TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO THE 
                          PROGRAM IS   12345<RET>
      The password may be altered by the user to any alpha/numeric
      combination up to 5 characters
