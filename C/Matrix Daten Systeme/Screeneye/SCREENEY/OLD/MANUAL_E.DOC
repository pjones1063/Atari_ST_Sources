1       Installation

1.1     Hardware
    The ScreenEye digitizer was especially developed for use inside the 
Atari Falcon 030 Computer. ScreenEye is to be plugged into the internal
extension bus  of the Falcon 030. The hardware installation should be done 
by your local sales representative, because the warranty seal underneath the 
computer has to removed. This may cause the loss of warranty. In case you 
install the hardware yourself refer to the installation guide in the following 
section.

1.1.1   Installation into the Falcon 030
    *** Ensure your computer is turned off and the power cable is disconnected 
    *** BEFORE you begin to install the hardware.

    First disconnect all connections from the Falcon 030. Underneath the 
computer all screws have to be removed that are located in square holes. After 
turning the keyboard upside you can remove the upper part of the case. Remove 
the connector of the keyboard cable from the main circuit board and the metal 
cover shown in figure 1 by removing the screws and by straightening the metal 
strips around the edges of the cover.

    Now the internal extension bus connectors can be seen in the left front 
area of the main circuit board. Two pins of the shorter row of pins (the one 
in front) are connected with a jumper. If the position of this jumper is not 
marked on the circuit board, do that yourself with a water resistant felt 
tipped pen (or s.th. similar) as shown in figure 2.

    The jumper has to be removed before ScreenEye can be plugged onto the 
connectors. If you want to operate your Falcon 030 without ScreenEye you have
to replace the jumper. So take care of it.

    If ScreenEye is connected to the compuer circuit board make sure it is 
placed correctly and not shifted (see figure 3). The video cable of ScreenEye 
lead between the metal and the plastic cover at the romport to the outside. 
If the male Cinch connector does not fit between metal and plastic cover bend 
the plastic carefully to the outside to make enough room for for the Cinch 
connector.

    Now you can mout your computer in reverse order.



1.1.2   Connection of a Video Source
    Connect the male Cinch connector of the ScreenEye video cable with your 
video camera (Video Out). Most of the common video cameras offer a female 
Cinch connector for >Video Out<.  In case your camera is equipped with a BNC 
connector, use a standard BNC-Cinch adaptor. If you want to connect a video 
tape recorder, tv set or satellite receiver, you need a SCART adaptor which 
can obtained separately. In chapter 7 



1.2     Software
    In the following table you can see which program is usually located in 
which directory.

     Program       Destination Dir.     e.g.           Function
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2a.   SCRN_EYE.PRG   ScreenEye-dir.       C:\SCRN_EYE\    ScreenEye program
       or rename as Accessory 
2b.   SCRN_EYE.ACC   Rootdir. Bootdrive   C:\             ScreenEye-Accessory



2       ScreenEye   -    User Manual

2.1     Basic Information
    SCRN_EYE.PRG may be used as an accessory as well. To do so copy the file 
to the root directory of your boot drive and rename it to SCR_EYE.ACC. The 
accessory is only active, if the computer is is booted in Falcon True Color
mode. Besides you have to ensure that the ScreenEye hardware is installed 
correctly and not shifted to warrant an error free boot phase.

    If an active video source is connected, SCRN_EYE.PRG/ACC starts in live 
video mode. If no video signal can be detected an empty window is displayed. 
In this case video input is controlled continually, so that after supplying a 
correct signal, the live image appears. In the actual version the display of 
the live video image is permanent, even if the ScreenEye window is not the top 
window. So the live video images 'shines through' other GEM windows possibly 
placed on top. The actual version is not yet complete, especially concerning 
handling of sequence parts and sound.

    ScreenEye needs the ScreenEye driver SCREYIF.PRG. This program must be 
started manually before SCRN_EYE.PRG or may also be placed in the \AUTO\ 
folder for automatic installation.


Note:
The actual version of ScreenEye can only be used in Falcon True Color mode. In 
all other color modes of the Falcon there is (affectecd by the Falcon 
organization of the video RAM) no rreal time display possible.


*** The ScreenEye disk may be copied freely and may be passed to others as a 
    demo disk. The film sequences on the disk can be displayed even without 
    the ScreenEye hardware.




2.2     Usage

2.2.1   Quickstart

    1. Start the Falcon in True Color mode.

    2. Copy the ScreenEye System Disk onto your harddisk drive (e.g. C:).

    3. Start SCREYIF.PRG, if it has not already been started in the \AUTO\ 
       folder. This program install the ScreenEye interface driver.

    4. Start SCREEN_EYE.PRG or install the accessory and reboot the computer.

                                            ^
    5. Load film sequence from disk: Select [] icon and choose 
       C:\FILM\SURF0000.JPG with the file selector box. Perhaps there is a 
       film sequence with another name on your disk.

    6. Start replay: Select []> icon.


    Please notice: It takes about 20 min to load or save a JPEG film sequence, 
    that fills all 14 MB of the Falcon RAM. It is recommended to save a once 
    loaded demo sequence in an uncompressed format (e.g. TGA sequence).

2.2.4   General Instruction Notes
    Functions in the Tool Bar are activated by clicking. Continual functions 
(Record, Play,  Save, Load, Live Video,  ...) may be stoppped by a second 
click on the same icon or on 'Stop'. 'Pause' pauses the active function, a 
second click on 'Pause' continues.

    If no continual function is active, the info line shows a short help text 
for the icon under the mouse pointer.

    Numeric fields can be handeled as follows:
One click with the left mouse button opens the field for numeric input, RETURN 
or a second left click close the field. The activated field can be recognized 
by the red border. Backspace deletes the last character. Input can be made 
with numeric keys or with '+' (count up) and '-' (count down). A right mouse 
click copies the actual position on the screen into the activated field.

    In the actual implementation film sequences are recorded in the chosen 
display resolution. When the film sequence is displayed, the same display mode 
(zoom  factor) should be used or only parts of the image will be visible.

    SCRN_EYE.PRG can be terminated by a right click on the close box or CTRL-Q.



2.2.5   Film Sequences on Disk
    A film sequence consists of a parameter file and one image file for each 
image of the sequence. So single images can be processed with an image 
processing application and afterwards integrated into the sequence.

    The name of a sequence may consist of up to 4 characters. The ohter 4 
characters of the file name are used for numbering the single image files.

    Film sequences are saved and displayed on principle with 32k colors. Full 
Images (DTP mode) are saved as uncompressed  24 bit TIF files.


The following formats may be used for image files:

  TGA:   Targa 16 bits per pixel (bpp), common for 16 bit color data
  JPG:   15 bpp expanded to 24 bpp; very compact, but slow (*)
  FLM:   binary data block without header, info in name.FLM, simple and fast
  TIC:   TIFF block format, 15 bpp expanded to 24 bpp
  TIF:   TIFF file, 24 bpp, only full images (DTP) mode

(*) Attention: It takes about 20 min to load or save a JPEG film sequence, 
    that fills all 14 MB of the Falcon RAM. It is recommended to save a often
    used sequence in an uncompressed format (e.g. TGA sequence).

The names of the files are:

    parameter file:  name.FLM

    image files:     TGA format:  name0000.TGA, name0001.TGA, ...
                    JPEG format:  name0000.JPG, name0001.JPG, ...
                  binary format:  name0000.FLM, name0001.FLM, ...
                     TIC format:  name0000.TIC, name0001.TIC, ...



2.2.6   Display Modes

Full Image Display:

    The image display area above the tool bar shows a full image with the chosen 
zoom factor. A left click on the icon 'Toggle Image/Film' or right click into 
the image display area switch to film sequence display mode.


Film Sequence Display:

    The image display area above the tool bar shows a film sequence. The 
number of horizontal and vertical displayed frames can be determined with the 
icon 'Number H/V Frames' in the lowest line of icons. A left click on one 
frame selects this frame. A right click on an frame also selects it  and 
besides that switches to the full image display mode and displays the selected 
frame in zoom mode. In film sequence mode unused frames in the sequence are 
left blank. For a single image record the first empty frame after the end of a 
sequence may be selected.

The active frame is marked with a red border.

The display mode can be toggled with the icon 'Toggle Image/Film'.

  []   Single Image -> Film:    The active frame is overwritten by a snapshot, 
                                the film is carried on one frame, so that 
                                continuous snapshots can be taken.
  v
  []   Save Film:      The active film sequence from [Min]..[Max] is written 
                       on disk. Name and location are determined with a file 
                       selector box. The maximum length of the name is 4 
                       characters, the used extension (TGA, TIC, JPG, FLM) 
                       determines the format of the image file.
                       If only one frame is active ([Min]=[Max]), only an 
                       image file without a parameter file name.FLM is written.
  ^
  []   Load Film:      The images of a film sequence with the numbers [Min]<=
                       nnnn<=[Max] are loaded. An existing film has to be 
                       deleted previously (-> Trash Can). The name of the 
                       sequence is determined with the file selector box. The 
                       extension of the file name is optional, for the format 
                       of the image file is read from the parameter file 
                       name.FLM.

Loading or saving of a film sequence may be aborted with [#] Stop and 
interrupted with II Pause.

  OO
  []   Trash Can:      The actual sequence is deleted, when you click on this 
                       icon. In coming versions also single frames and 
                       specified numbers of frames will be deletable.

  []<)) Sound On/Off:  When activated in live video mode a sound signal 
                       connected to the Falcon microphone input is audible on 
                       the internal speaker. In coming versions the sound will 
                       also be recorded.

  [][] Zoom </>:       The size of the image display area above the tool bar 
                       is made smaller (left click) or bigger (right click).

  []   Toggle Image/Film:    Switches between full image and film sequence 
                             display.

  I[]I Single Image -> TIF file:    An image is digitized in 24 bits per pixel 
                                    (for the present in 256 GS) in the full 
                       resolution (720 x576) and saved as uncompressed TIF 
                       image. The name of the file is determined with a file 
                       selector box. The legth of the file name may be up to 
                       8 characters. The file name extension must be TIF. The 
                       half frames will be digitized with a distance of time 
                       so that a good still-film picture (e.g. camera) is 
                       necessary. The distance of the two half frame 
                       recordings is about 10 seconds at the moment. In the 
                       next software version the distance will be about 1/2 
                       a second.

  [NAME] Name of the Film:    Displays the name of the sequence loaded or 
                              saved last.

                       gain=g*32; attenuation=(2*a+1)*16; max=70, min=07}

  [XY] Zoom mode:      numeric field: [XY] shows the  horizontal (X: 1 digit) 
                       and vertical (Y: 1 digit) zoom factors, is stepped up 
                       with 'Zoom  </>' icon (see table with resolutions in 
                       chapter 4)

  [HV] Number of H/V Frames:    numeric field: [HV] displays the number of 
                                horizontal (H: 1 digit) and vertical (V: 1 
                       digit) frames in the image display area above the tool 
                       bar. { valid range: 22..99 (2x2..9x9 images); total 
                       number of frames = H*V; HV = 00: all images of a 
                       sequence are displayed; H or V = 0: choose this 
                       parameter so, that all frames can be displayed; 
                       H or V = 1 => H or V = 16 (max)!

  [Max] Maximum:       numeric field: Upper limit for loading and saving
                       sequences and for the max. number of reserved frame 
                       when recording (default = 999 = as much as possible, 
                       depends on the RAM size).


  Running Film Strip:  Shows with color and movement the active operating 
                       mode. A click on the film strip shows an open hand as 
                       mouse pointer. Moving this hand up and down moves the 
                       film strip forward and backwards. When exceeding the 
                       Min/Max limits, the film is displayed fast (corresponds 
                       with << and >>). This moving works in both display 
                       modes.

  [X] Close Box:       With a left mouse click the tooll bar can be hidden. 
                       This is especially usefull in the lowest zoom mode or 
                       or if you want to display or digitize with maximum 
                       speed. The HELP key toggles the tool bar on and off. 

                       A right click on the close box terminates the program.

  After a left click into the image display area above the tool bar or on the 
  empty spaces between the frames of film sequence the window is grabbed and 
  may be positioned on the desktop if the window title bar usually used for 
  that is hidden.

  Info Line:           In this line first the version of the software is dis-
                       played. If any error occur here you can see an error 
                       message. Otherwise information is shown about any 
                       active function. When inactive you get a short in-
                       formation about the icon beneath the mouse arrow.

3       ScreenEye - Developers-Kit / Driver SCREYIF.PRG

    SCREYIF.PRG contains all basic input and output functions of SCRN_EYE.PRG 
concerning digitizing and displaying film sequences. The ScreenEye Developers 
Kit enables a developer to use this functions and consists of a diskette with 
the following files:

- ScreenEye driver: SCREYIF.PRG
- header files for SCREYIF.PRG interface
- object files for Pure C, as bindings for own applications
- demo program SCRYDEMO.PRG as Pure C source file with project file

Please note:
- The ScreenEye Developers Kit is supplied free for charge with ScreenEye.
- Right now there is no documentation available.
- Because this version is only a preliminary one, changes are very likely.




4       Resolutions / Technical Data

    The purpose of ScreenEye is to use the capabilities of Falcon 030 as a 
video machine to an optimum. On the other side it wants to give a reasonable 
entrance to real time video digitizing. This aim was achieved by using highly 
integrated, dynamically configurable logic chips:

- ScreenEye takes optimal advantage of the bandwidth of the Falcon 030 
  extension bus.

- Easier and thus cheaper solutions can only be obtained with concessions to 
  resolution or speed.

- Dynamic configuration means that the hardware does not consist of fixed wire 
  connections, but of logic data in the software. ( -> flexibility, easy 
  update possibility)

- The following results can be achieved with the actual version of the software
  and will become better by continuos optimizing.
