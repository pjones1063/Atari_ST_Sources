                              Why Did We Write It?

  JPEG.ACC was first written for testing the Atari JPEG Driver. It allowed us
to test all features of the driver, and helped us in finding and correcting
bugs. It only works on a Falcon, with the JPEG Driver version 0.90á or higher.



                           Required Configuration:

  JPEG.ACC only works on the Atari Falcon computer, and needs the DSP JPEG
Decoder from Atari (JPEGD.PRG). It doesn't contain JPEG decoding routines. It
just calls the Atari JPEG decoder, dither the image (if needed), and display the
result on a window. Dithering routines have been written for all Falcon standard
graphic modes (2, 4, 16, 256 colors). True color 15 bits mode is of course
implemented too.



                               How To Run It:

  You can use it as a program, or as an accessory (just rename it). The main
advantage of using it as an accessory is that several files can be decoded
and displayed. When running it (program) or calling it (accesory), a file
selector appears. Just select a JPEG file. The decoding now begins. Note that
there is an 'evnt_multi' call in the main decoding loop, allowing you to
use your computer while the image is decoded and dithered. That's why there is
no BUSY mouse during the decoding. When the decoding and dithering if finished,
a window is opened, whowing the JPEG image. If the image is bigger than the
window, you can scroll through it, pressing the left mouse button, and moving
the mouse.



                              Dithering Modes:

  The following dithering algorithms are used:
2 colors:	Ordered dithering, using a 4x4 Bayer matrix (black/white).
4 colors:	Ordered dithering, using a 4x4 Bayer matrix (4 greyscales).
16 colors:	Ordered dithering, using a 2x2 Bayer matrix (16 grescales).
256 colors:	Ordered dithering,  using a 4x4 Bayer matrix (256 colors).
15 Bits TC:	No dithering.

The main reason of using ordered dithering with a fixed palette is that
several pictures can be displayed at the same time, using the same palette.



                                 Speed:

  The speed of JPEG.ACC is not really significative of DSP JPEG decoder speed,
since there is an 'evnt_multi' in its main decoding loop. The image dithering
(for all non-truecolor modes) is a very slow process too (up to 50% of the total
time), specially in 256 colors mode. The current version of the Decoder (0.90)
decodes about 125000 pixels/sec for most images. JPEG.ACC speed (decoding plus
dithering) is really slower, and depends a lot on the screen resolution (the
256 colors dithering routine is the slowest one).



                     Multitasking (Accessory Version):

  While decoding a JPEG file, you can go to the Desk menu and select another
image. The current decoding is paused, the new image is decoded and displayed,
and then the 'old' decoding continues. If you install several copies of
JPEG.ACC in your Desk menu-bar, YOU CAN REALLY DECODE several files at the same
time. Note that you can't decode more than 32 files at the same time. It's the
internal limit of the JPEG driver. Under MultiTOS, you can run it several times
as a program too.



                                Bugs:

  There are several known bugs/incompatibilities:

1: NEVER kill JPEG.ACC while it's decoding a file (by changing the current
resolution, or dragging it to the trash if under MultiTOS). The results are
unpredictables. This may be fixed in a future version.

2: Under TOS 4.04, the window sliders don't work. This problem doesn't exist
under TOS 4.92 or MultiTOS 1.08 (so whose bug ... ?).

3:  If there is a memory or disk error, strange things may happen (we tried
to test this carefully, but nobody knows...).

4:   Under MultiTOS (v1.08), the accessory sometimes crashes when displaying the
image, if you're using NVDI (memory violation). It seems to be a NVDI bug,
since everything works ok if you remove NVDI.



                         Note For Programmers:

  The Atari JPEG decoder is a program belonging to Atari Corp. If you want to
use it in your applications, please contact your Atari representative.
