ttf2gem
=======

ttf2gem does what it says - it creates accurate gem fonts from true type fonts.

There's a very wide choice of true type fonts ttf2gem helps you can create
the corresponding gem fonts that you need.

With ttf-gdos, it's best to use gem fonts (i.e. bit maps) for small font sizes
for speed and accuracy because TTF-GDOS doesn't do hinting (that would make it
big and slow).

ttf2gem does the big & slow stuff, it uses the freetype font hinting engine to
create accurate gem fonts.

It is easy to use. Just run it, choose your true type font then put in your gem
font file name and point size.   It will even suggest a font id for you, if
the ttf file contains the right information.
