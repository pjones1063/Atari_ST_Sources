      1) added _mneed to allow for additional big Malloc. Setting _mneed
         instructs the Lattice startup code to do an Mshrink to that size; this
         allows an additional big Malloc later on.
      2) added O_RAW flag to open mode (performance improvement). The Lattice
         read() and write() functions do implicit text translations if O_RAW is
         not specified (CR/LF to LF on input, and LF to CR/LF on output).
         Setting O_RAW allows for better I/O performance.
      3) Two functions loinit() and loread() were created so that large blocks
         can be read.
      4) modifications to GetPatFile() to read stdin (read() from stdin in
         Lattice C returns after first newline read).
      5) modification to MatchFound() for exact match case. Since the text
         line still contains a '\r' in raw mode, in case of an exact match
         a check must be done for that character.
      6) "#define index(a,b) strchr(a,b)" and "#define cfree(a) free(a)"
         were added.
      7) modifications to PrintLine to explicitly use Cconws() instead of
         printf() (allowing for redirection).
      8) modifications in makefile to support ST file names, and circumvent
         TOS argument string limitations
