This is Dave Betz' xlisp 2.1.

The binary is for the Atari ST.

There are speedups and bugfixes from 2.0 -- none of them mine, I
hasten to add, they're from various usenet gurus and C/Lisp hackers.

I haven't exercised it fully, but so far it seems to be able to cope
with my existing source code. The save and restore options are
enabled and they seem (trivially) to work.

BTW -- the "system" function works, (system "C:\\BIN\\VI.TTP") will
run vi.ttp (well, it does on my 1040 anyway), but xlisp is probably
best run from gulam, switching between source file buffers to gulam
as appropriate. It's not too bad, I developed a simple object-based
rule interpreter in that "development environment".

Acknowledgements should go (amongst others) to Tom Almy of Tektronix
and Niels Mayer of Hewlett-Packard who between them, seem to have
made the deepest changes to Xlisp and to J.Bammi of CWRU for providing
the ST port of GNU C 1.37-1 with which I compiled the sources.

Last but not least, Hewlett-Packard Labs' (Bristol) communications
infrastructure allowed me access to U.S. archive machines and thus
the source code for Xlisp 2.1 and the ST binaries for GNU C.
