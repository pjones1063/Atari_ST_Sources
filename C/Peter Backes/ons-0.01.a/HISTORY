= History ===================================  PLASMA           #PAPAYA#

* 0.01.a                       09.06.2003     <rtc>
- gfalist.c/process(), sky.c/gf4tp_getdi, sky.h, tables.c/gfarecl[]: 
  Added rudimentary support for recognition of files written by 
  Amiga/MS-DOS/Windows interpreters.

* 0.00.a.pl11                  29.05.2003     <rtc>
- packdist.sh: Implemented manifest file distribution file exclusion 
  list.
- packdist.sh: Compacted code a bit.
- Makefile: Improved distribution packing wiring.
- packdist.sh: Now builds rpms from package in current directory.

* 0.00.a.pl10                  08.09.2002     <lp>
- sky.c/gf4tp_tp(): Fixed some minor comment alignment problems.
- tables.c/gfalct[]: Fixed TRON token expansion.

* 0.00.a.pl9                   06.09.2002     <lp>
- sky.c/gf4tp_tp(): Corrected quote decoding in strings.

* 0.00.a.pl8                   01.09.2002     <rtc>
- charset.c/charset[]: Added some more tokens and fixed existing ones.

* 0.00.a.pl7                   26.08.2002     <lp>
- tables.c/gfalct[]: added missing tokens: 192  'MONITOR', 1724 'MAT NEG',
  1728 'MAT ABS'

* 0.00.a.pl6                   30.09.2001     <rtc>
- Made build more flexible.
- sky.h/struct gfainf_t, struct gfahdr_t, struct gfalin_t: Removed '_t'
  in those structure tags.  '_t' as a variable suffix is reserved
  by POSIX and should generally be used for types only, not for tags.
- tables.c: Fixed indenting.  Several lines had tabulators in them
  which really should be space.

* 0.00.a.pl5                   10.09.2001     <rtc>
- Converted the wole SKY thing to C and wrote some funky build toys.
- Translated most strings to English, including this history file.
- Split SKY as a library from the GF4TP token processor program
- Allow negative indent values.
- sky.c: Handle label indendation case.
- sky.c: Sometimes superfluous spaces were appended.  In the most obvious 
  cases this was corrected.  Maybe there are some left.
- sky.c: Each .GFA file is ended by a line which only contains an end 
  of file marker.  This case was fixed to not erroneously output an 
  empty line.

* 0.00.a.pl4                   06.10.1996     <rtc>
- sky.gfa/gf4tp_scan_header(): made dimensioning take place *after* the 
  maximum variable count has been being read
- sky.gfa/gf4tp_getmax(): New. Does exactly what is says.
- sky.gfa/gf4tp_tp$(): Cleaned up the command tokens which are followed by 
  two, four or six bytes of additional information.  Some were duplicate, 
  some at the wrong place (especially FOR and NEXT tokens).
- sky.gfa/gf4tp_tp$(): Corrected forgotten addition at SELECT x$ (Noticed 
  when trying to decode ERGO_TP)

* 0.00.a.pl3                   23.09.1996     <rtc>
- sky.gfa/gf4tp_init(): Reading variable suffixes
- sky.gfa/gf4tp_tp$(): Extreme shortening by using indexed variable suffixes
- sky.gfa/gf4tp_tp$(): Fixed forgotten decreasing of variable number in word 
  format variable tokens had been forgotten (noticed randomly)
- sky.gfa/gf4tp_tp$(): folded procedures now defined via tokens.

* 0.00.a                                      <rtc>
- First alpha version
