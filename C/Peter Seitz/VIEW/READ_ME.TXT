
Some notes on the contents of the VIEW folder:


GEM_VIEW.003 and GEM_XACC.101 contain examples from Dieter Fiebelkorn 
for the View / XAcc Protocol,

ENVIRON contains a program which allows to set the environment of the 
desktop, which can be used to set the 'View' variable.

VIEW_xxx.TXT is the doc for the View Protocol,

XACC_MT.TXT is the doc for the XAcc Protocol,

VIEW.C, VIEW.H is an example how to use a viewer out of own programs, 
but it doesn't work without my GEM-library; therefore it is just 
meant as a hint how it could be implemented.

VIEWPROT.H contains the defines for the view messages.


If there are any problems, feel free to consult me - you find 
my address in the view_xxx.txt file.
