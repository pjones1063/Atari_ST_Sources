!!! WARNING! Read carefully !!!

The default ACSI IDs of UltraSatan are 0 and 1 (it has 2 card slots, 
thus it has 2 ACSI IDs). 

Please note that if you have some other device with the ACSI ID 0 or 1
connected to your ST, then you should disconnect it from the ACSI bus 
until you configure the ACSI IDs of UltraSatan to different values.

EVERY ACSI device must have UNIQUE ACSI ID! Two devices CAN'T have 
the same ACSI IDs. If you setup two devices on ACSI bus with the same IDs,
they might get damaged!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to configure the UltraSatan:

1. Connect UltraSatan to ST, power up ST and UltraSatan
2. Run the US_CONF.PRG, and it will search for UltraSatan on ACSI bus.
3. Use arrows to move up and down.
4. If you are positioned on the firmware list, use 'space' to select 
   which firmware you want to boot. Or press 'U' to upload new firmware.
   You should choose the new firmware (*.ldr) and press the OK button.
5. If you are on the device list, press 0 to 7 to set the new device ID.
6. To write the new device ID configuration and selected firmware to boot,
   press the 'W' button to write the settings.
7. Turn off and on your UltraSatan and it will start with the new 
   configuration and with the selected firmware.
8. To change the INQUIRY name of device (which you see when the ST boots
   and the driver shows the names of devices), pres 'i' key, enter the
   new INQUIRY name and pres 'Return'.
9. To quit the configurator, press 'Q'.

What to do when you screw up the firmware selection?

If you will select the non-uploaded firmware for booting, or the upladed 
and selected firmware is corrupted, your UltraSatan will not boot and
thus will not work. When this happens, open the case of UltraSatan,
find the 'BOOT ALWAYS BASE FW' pins and connect them with a jumper.
When this jumper is present, the UltraSatan will always start with 
the base firmware no matter what other firmware you select. With the 
base firmware running, run the configurator and fix the situation
(select or upload the proper firmware).

The configurator will show in the 'Boot always base firmware' line:
- 'YES' if the jumper is present and it will boot the base firmware always 
- 'NO'  if the jumper is NOT present and it will boot firmware which you 
   selected
