README FOR E:\SRC\WORK\ALN

This directory contains aln.  It's a production tool and shouldn't need
much of anything in the way of maintenance.  I don't know if I have ever
built this on an ST, or if it was always built on the VAX.  I'm sure it'll
want Alcyon C, but not the really old one.

The last thing that got done to this is that the "kill list" didn't work --
the "don't kill me" list couldn't be more than one symbol long.  Now it
can.  That was in 1991.
