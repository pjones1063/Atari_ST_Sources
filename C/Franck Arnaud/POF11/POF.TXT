>>> WHAT?
---------

    POF! is a filelister for LazyBBS, it produces the master list of files 
    of your board. The list can be put for download for users, and/or be
    requestable under the FILES fidonet magic freq name.

    It was written for use with LazyBBS, but can be used with for any 
    board using FILES.BBS like download areas. LazyBBS is Fidonet BBS 
    software for a Pandora message base, currently available on Unix
    and Atari STs.

    To port it, look at the beginning pof.c for defines... and compile 
    pof.c. Unix users don't forget to convert crlf text files to lf files 
    if your copy comes from with crlf.
    

>>> HOW?
--------
    
    You call _pof_ with the configuration file on the command line, and 
    the output will be sent to stdout (the console as default, can/should 
    be redirected).
    
    Command line options:

    -d<days>      (NOT -d <days>) may be used to produce a list of only 
                  recent files.

    -l<logfile>   log errors and filelist report to a standard fido log

    
    Example: pof pof.cfg >allfile.txt
             pof -d30 pof.cfg >lastmonth.txt
             pof -lpof.log another.pof >another.txt
             
    The format of the pof.cfg file is:
    
    - Any line beginning with ; is a comment
    
    - Any line beginning with @ or # is a control line:
        
        @<file>     file to be included
        #<comment>  comment to be included in the output
        
    - Any line not beginning with ; or # or @ is a path to be scanned.
    
    Example:
    -----<cut>----------------<cut>----------------<cut>--------
    ;
    ; Sample POF config
    ;
    ; now insert my BBS desc
    @/usr/bbs/ads/mybbs.txt
    #
    # The Filelist of Local Things
    # ----------------------------
    #
    ; now scan FILES.BBS and fancy display list
    /usr/bbs/download/atari
    /usr/bbs/download/linux-for-crays
    ; other files and comments now
    #
    # File Distribution Network
    # -------------------------
    #
    /usr/bbs/download/winnet
    /usr/bbs/download/craynet
    ; this is the end
    -----<cut>----------------<cut>----------------<cut>--------
