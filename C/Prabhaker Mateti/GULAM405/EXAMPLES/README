
Here are a few ".g" files that I use.

There is no guarantee.
I use them this way now.  Probably tomorrow I will change them all.

In one of them, MULTIVOL.G, I use the "VOL" program that installs
a volume id.  The volume ID is used by that marvelous (free)
program to create an index or a directory with DISKSCAN by
Todd Burkey <trb@stag.UUCP>.

In another, INSTALL.G, the cp command is used to copy ".PRG" files
from the ram disk to an AUTO folder in a predetermined, repeatable
order.  This helped me to get my boot disk just the way I wanted it.

With another, CPSETUP, a bunch of files are copied to my ramdisk.

You might get some ideas about something you would like to do for
yourself.   Have fun.
