The make process for GCC requires a shell program with some
abilities not available in Gulam. I came up with the
following set of files to help others compile GCC on their
Atari's.
 
The source files of GCC come from the atari.archive FTP site.
You must first acquire these before this package is any good.
 
You will need the gcc source files, object libraries, gnu make,
executables, and other things from the atari.archive. Plan on
spending a few evenings looking over the various packages, sorting
them out.
 
The package provides a cross-compiler system that allows you to,
for example, compile atari source on a SUN and take that
executable and run it on the atari. I wasn't able to get this to
come up very easily on my work computer, so I did it all on the Atari ST.
 
You will need a LOT of MEMORY and DISK SPACE for all this stuff.
I had to re-partition my hard disk to have a 32Meg partition.
I don't think you can get by with a 16 Meg partition. You
will probably also need 4Meg of RAM, since a RAMdisk is probably
essential. I don't think some of the files will compile in 2.5 Meg,
but this is just an impression. After you get everything set up
(which might take a few days), the build process takes 3 hours.
 
With all that said, here's a listing of the contents of this package:

   makenote.txt   - some documentation
   makegcc.g      - the gulam 'make' file - uses the next three:
   makegen        - a makefile to build atari instruction generators
   makeinsn.g     - a gulam script to create the instruction files
   makelast       - the final make after instruction generators are built
   clean.g        - the equivalent of 'make clean'
   directry.txt   - the complete directory structure I used
 
 
Good luck!
