This is a alpha version of a GFA Library for Draconis.

It may be included in your own program without any
charges. The only thing you have to do, is that there
should be a text in your program information (ABOUT- 
dialog for GEM programs, Version-Info for TOS programs)
that the program is using the "Draconis GFA Library".
