This folder contains standard CAT source. You are encouraged to change the 
files in this folder, but make sure you BACK THEM UP FIRST.

If you design any neat processing, I would be very grateful if you could send
me a copy..... either a listing of your new code, or preferably a disk 
containing your new improved standard file. I intend to update the standard 
files to incorporate new ideas from YOU, and distribute them to registers
users at regular intervals. 

If you do send me any new source, please comment your changes. 


Thanks,
	Tony


Remember:
          The definitions in ZZRQD.D are required. You can change the 
          text, but you must keep the original names.

          The definitions in ZZSTD.D are not required, but it is these that
          provide most of the logic for your adventure. If you remove any
          processing from ZZSTD, consider all the side effects of what you
          are changing!
