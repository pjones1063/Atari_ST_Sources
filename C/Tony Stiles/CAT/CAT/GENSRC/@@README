

This folder contains the C source required to link with generated adventure
data. The source in this folder is not commented - this is because I do not 
want to encourage people to change this code. Anyone who changes anything 
in this folder does so at their own risk!! 

If you are trying to make adventures work for another compiler other than
Sozobon C on the ST, MWC on the ST, or TurboC on the PC... you should look
in the portab.i file. This file should contain all machine specific code.
You should compile your adventure with a new directive i.e. -DAMIGA, and
then protect your Amiga specific code with #ifdef AMIGA.

PLEASE DO NOT use the #else directive. You should specifically test for 
your machine - this will ensure that portab.h can indeed be ported to many
machines without too much heart-ache.

If anyone makes any changes to portab.h that they think may be useful to 
other users on the same machine, then please do let me have a copy.

	Thanks,
		Tony.
