Subject: GNOME readme file

        GNOME version 2.1

 Original code written by Dave G. Conroy,
 Substantially modified by Moshe Braner, 1986, 1988.
 Program name changed from microEMACS to GNOME.

 Parts of the program Copyright (c) 1986, 1988 by Moshe Braner.

 Permission is granted to copy and use this program,

The sources are in the *.c and ed.h files,
and also in ARCed form in source.arc.

The ST executable GNOME.TTP, ARCed, is in gnttp.arc.
The MS-DOS executable GNOME.EXE, ARCed, is in gnexe.arc.
For other systems you'll have to recompile: see below for details.

For a basic tutorial type "gnome gnome.tut".
(On the Atari ST: double-click GNOME.TTP, type "gnome.tut" <Return>.)

For a list of command-line options type "gnome -h".

On the Atari ST: print the file "flabels", paste above the function keys.
(On MS-DOS machines you can make your own template (a la WP) to put
around the function keys.)

If you use GNOME on UNIX you should add this line to your ".login" file:
        setenv GNOMELOG /mu/yourname/.gnomelog
(Otherwise, ".gnomelog" would be created in EVERY directory GNOME is
invoked in.  That is a log of keystrokes, to help recover work in case
of a system crash while editing.)  Also advisable:
        setenv VISUAL /???/gnome
        setenv EDITOR /???/gnome
(??? should be "usr/local", or wherever it is on your system).


To compile GNOME:

Macro #defines in "ed.h" must be set for the target system,
and for some choices, such as whether built-in help is to
be compiled.

To compile on UNIX, these are the recommended settings in "ed.h":

        #define V7      1
        #define VMS     0
        #define CPM     0
        #define MSDOS   0
        #define AtST    0

        #define TCCONIO 0
        #define ANSI    0
        #define VT52    0
        #define TERMCAP 1

        #define VT100   1
        ...

        #define CANLOG  1
        ...

        #define HELP    1
        #define EXTRA   1
        ...

        #define BFILES  0
        ...

        #define SLEEP   1

Type "cc *.c -ltermcap" to create the executable file.

To compile on the Atari ST (I used Laser C),
these are the recommended settings:

        #define V7      0
        #define VMS     0
        #define CPM     0
        #define MSDOS   0
        #define AtST    1

        #define TCCONIO 0
        #define ANSI    0
        #define VT52    1
        #define TERMCAP 0

        #define VT100   0
        ...

        #define BFILES  1

To compile on MS-DOS, using Turbo C (version 1.5 or later),
these are the recommended settings:

        #define V7      0
        #define VMS     0
        #define CPM     0
        #define MSDOS   1
        #define AtST    0

        #define TCCONIO 1
        #define ANSI    0
        #define VT52    0
        #define TERMCAP 0

        #define VT100   0
        ...

        #define BFILES  1
