[1mDESCRIPTION[m
        The [1mman[m command finds and displays  information  in  the  online
        documentation set.   When the standard output is a terminal, [1mman[m
        pipes its output through [1mless[m(1) or  the  name  of  the  command
        specified with the MANPAGER or PAGER environment variables.  

[1mOPTIONS[m
        The following command line arguments are recognized:  

        [1m-[m       Pipes  the  output through [1mcat[m(1) rather than [1mless[m(1) or
                PAGER.  

        [1m-ul[m     Use [1mul[m(1) rather than [1mcat[m(1). 

        [1m-M[m [4mpath[m  
                Specifies a directory in which to search.   By  default,
                [1mman[m searches in c:\man or the directory specified by the 
                MANPATH  environment variable, the standard location for
                online documentation.    This  option  is   useful   for
                debugging new manpages.   For example,  assuming you are
                working on a manpage named "mycmd.1", you can do this:

                        man -M . 1 mycmd

        [1m-s[m [4msect[m[[4msubsect[m]  
                Specifies  a  [4msection[m  and [4msubsection[m similar to the 4.2
                BSD UNIX Programmer's Manual  (as  explained  below)  in
                which to  search.    If  no  [4msection[m  is  specified, [1mman[m
                searches through all of the sections.  Example: "man  -s
                3s fopen".  

        [4msect[m    As  an  alternative  to  [1m-s[m, you can specify the section
                (and  optional  subsection)  as  the   first   argument.
                Example: "man 3s fopen".  

        [4mname[m    Searches  for  documentation  files  associated with the
                specified [4mname[m.

        [1m-f[m [4mfile[m  
                Displays  a   one   line   synopsis   of   each   online
                documentation  file whose names match the specified word
                (equivalent to the [1mwhatis[m(1)  command).    For  example,
                "man  -f  chmod" will give entries for both [1mchmod[m(1) and
                [1mchmod[m(2). Note that [1mman[m invokes [1mwhatis[m(1) in this  case,
                so it should be found in BINDIR (see ENVIRONMENT).  

        [1m-k[m [4mkeyword[m  
                Displays   a   one   line   synopsis   of   each  online
                documentation file whose name  or  description  contains
                the  specified  [4mkeyword[m  (equivalent  to  the [1mapropos[m(1)
                command).  Note that  [1mman[m  invokes  [1mapropos[m(1)  in  this
                case,   so   it   should   be   found   in  BINDIR  (see
                ENVIRONMENT).  


[1mENVIRONMENT[m
        The following environment variables are recognized: 

        MANPATH  
                Location of main manual direcotry, where  subdirectories
                are to  be  found.   [1mMan[m uses (in order of priority) the
                path specified with [1m-M[m, the MANPATH  specified,  or  the
                built-in default (c:\man).  

        MANPAGER  
                Name of  prefered  pager.    Use  this pager if you have
                compressed manpages  (see  [1mmanpager[m(1)).  [1mMan[m  will  use
                first MANPAGER,  if  found,  then  PAGER,  if found.  If
                neither are found, it uses c:\bin\less.ttp.

        PAGER  
                Name of secondary pager to replace [1mless[m(1). Use this  if
                you  do  not  have  manpages generated with font changes
                (see [1mnroff[m(1)).

        BINDIR  
                Alternate location to find  all  necessary  executables.
                The default  is  c:\bin.   You need [1mless[m(1), [1mcat[m(1), and
                [1mul[m(1) at a minimum.  

        TMPDIR  
                Place to put temporary files, if necessary.  Default  is
                g:\tmp.   Make  it a ramdisk partition, if you have one.
                So far this is not used.  

[1mSECTION NAMES[m
        The "sections" of the manual are: 

        Sect	Section Name	Description
        ----	-------------	--------------------------------------
        0	General		overview of features and documentation
        1	Commands	user commands
        2	System Calls	low-level system library calls (C)
        3	Library Calls	standard user calls (C)
        4	Special Files	special system files and hardware
        5	File formats	things like arc(1) file formats
        6	Games		games manual
        7	Miscellaneous	miscellaneous information
        8	Administration	system administration commands

        In addition, [1mman[m recognizes the following section names: 

        local		files specific to local system
        new		files added since current software release
        old		files from previous software release

        The search order, if no section is specified, is: 

        108234576

        In addition to sections,  there  are  a  number  of  subsections
        possible,  though  these  files  do  not  reside  in  a  special
        directory.  The subsection name is simply appended to  the  file
        name.   Example: fopen.3s resides in c:\man\man3, the section is
        "3" (libraries) and the subsection is "s", stdio.  Here  is  the
        subsection  search  order  for  subsections in each section (the
        square brackets mean a choice of  each  character  contained  in
        them, in that order): 

        man1\*.1[tcgesla]	util & text, com, graphics, edit, shell,
        			lang, archival
        man0\*.0
        man8\*.8[s]		util & system
        man2\*.2[gbx]		system & gemdos, bios, xbios
        man3\*.3[msvcxg]	C lib & math, stdio, sysV, compat,
        			extra, gem(aes/vdi)
        man4\*.4[dkvscm]	general & disk, keyboard, video, sound,
        			chips, memory
        man5\*.5
        man7\*.7
        man6\*.6

[1mNOTES[m
        To  save  disk  space, you can "source" other files by including
        the [1mnroff[m(1) directive ".so" in a file as the first  line.    In
        this  case,  the first line should start with .so followed by at
        least one space, then the file to  use  instead  of  the  actual
        manpage.  For example, the manpage for feof.3s (in MANPATH\man3) 
        contains the single line: 

        	.so man3\ferror.3s

        which  will  cause  [1mman[m  to  display  the  contents of ferror.3s
        instead.  Note  the  relative  path  (relative  to  MANPATH,  by
        default c:\man).   In this way, numerous manpages can refer to a
        single (larger) file.  Do not compress files with  source  lines
        as [1mman[m only checks for this line if it finds a file which is not 
        compressed.   Note  that you can only compress files for viewing
        with [1mmanpager[m(1) and must set the MANPAGER environment  variable
        as well.  

[1mFILES[m
        c:\man		root of standard manual page directory tree
        c:\man\man*\*	manual entries
        c:\lib\whatis	table of contents and keyword database

[1mSEE ALSO[m
        apropos(1), cat(1), less(1), manpager(1),  nroff(1),  whatis(1),
        whatisin(1), whereis(1), man(7)
