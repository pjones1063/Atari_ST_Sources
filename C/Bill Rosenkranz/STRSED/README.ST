ported from a code posted to comp.source.misc. this seems like it could be
useful. note this is a lib routine. GNU .o files are included. built with
gcc 1.40 with MiNT lib PL 19 headers.

the regex package here is from GNU e?grep, v1.16. i built the check progs
and tested them. output is in file out.

manpage is strsed.m3c and nroffed version is strsed.3c (for manpager).

enjoy...
