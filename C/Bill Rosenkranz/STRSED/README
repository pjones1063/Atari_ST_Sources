Strsed is another string function. It does regular expression search
and replace (including tr(1)-like transliteration) in the style of the
ed/edit/ex text editors.

Here are a few examples:

  (change "fred" to "joe")        strsed(s, "s/fred/joe/", 0);

  (change all "fred"s to "joe")   strsed(s, "g/fred/joe/", 0);

  (delete all a's)                strsed(s, "g/a//", 0);

  (change fred and what follows
   to upper case)                 strsed(s, "s/fred.*/{a-z}{A-Z}/", 0);

  (strip repeated letters
   in the ranges a-z and 0-9)     strsed(s, "g/\([a-z0-9]\)\1+/\1/", 0);

  (search for a number in s)      int range[2];
                                  strsed(s, "/[0-9]*/", range);
                                  /* indices of the matched portion are
                                     returned in range[0] & range[1] */


and there's more...  See the man page in 'strsed.3c' for details.

It is general enough to be able to emulate most of the usual more
complicated string functions (including strchr, strrchr, strpbrk,
strspn, strcspn and strtok), and can perform complicated string
manipulations that are otherwise a major headache.

The GNU regex package is needed for linking. The necessary source
files are regex.c and regex.h which were included in the GNU 18.55
(and 18.54) emacs distribution.  Both are expected to be in the
current directory when you type 'make'.

Strsed is distributed with no conditions or guarantees attached.
Bear in mind however that the GNU license applies to the regex
sources.

This was developed in a (basically) System V environment using gcc
(1.37), but there should be no problem at all in compiling it on BSD
or elsewhere - everything is very standard.

To compile, copy or link the GNU regex.{c,h} files into the current
directory and type 'make'. If you do not have gcc then change the
Makefile to use cc. Some compilers (NOT gcc) (notably MIPS' cc) have
been known to have problems compiling regex.c into something that will
run without coredumping.

This will produce 'strsed.o'. As well as this, two checking programs
will be compiled and example files will be run. If all is well you
will get the two messages:

  Substitution and transliteration tests passed successfully.
  Searching tests passed successfully.

Indicating that things are OK.



Have fun...
