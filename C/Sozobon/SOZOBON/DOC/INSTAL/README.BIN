                             Version 1.0

The files in this archive are:

readme     This file.

doc.arc    Documentation for the compiler, and for the 'make' utility.

lib.arc    Archive containing the floating point library.

bin.arc    Archive of the executables.


These files comprise the executable portion of the Sozobon compiler. To
use the compiler you'll also need a copy of the runtime library "dLibs"
(version 1.2) which should be available wherever you received this file.
The source code for the compiler should also be available, although it
isn't needed if you don't plan to modify the compiler or any of it's
utilities.

To install the compiler we recommend a directory structure like the
following:


        \sozobon
                All compiler-related files can go under this top-level
                directory. The following names can be used directly
                under the root directory by omitting "sozobon" from
                the following path names. The compiler will work fine
                with either arrangement.

                \sozobon\bin
                        Un-arc the file "bin.arc" here.

                \sozobon\doc
                        Un-arc the file "doc.arc" here.

                \sozobon\lib
                        Un-arc "lib.arc" here. The startup code and
                        library from the dLibs release go here too.

                \sozobon\include
                        The header files from the dLibs release go here.





Other arrangements are possible depending on the configuration of your
system. See the full documentation for a description of how environment
variables can be used to deviate from the directory structure above.
