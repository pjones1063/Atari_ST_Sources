This is the disk release of the Sozobon compiler. The files on this
disk are:

readme		This file.

arc.ttp		An 'arc' program adapted for the ST by Howard Chu.

dlibs12.arc	Version 1.2 of Dale Schumacher's dLibs library for
		the Sozobon or Alcyon C compilers. Source code for
		the library is included in this archive.

sc_bin.arc	The binaries and documentation for the Sozobon C
		compiler. This file and dLibs are all most people will
		ever use.

sc_src.arc	Source code for the compiler. Only needed if you
		plan to modify the compiler or its utilities.

sc_desk.arc	A modified version of the 'cc' command that's better
		suited for use from the desktop. Also includes a batch
		file processor written by Ian Lepore.

To install the compiler, we recommend unpacking "sc_bin.arc" first
and reading the "readme.bin" file there. Next, unpack "dlibs12.arc"
and install its contents. If you plan to use the compiler in a GEM
environment, you'll find the contents of sc_desk.arc helpful.

A copy of 'arc' is included in case you don't have a copy of this
utility. There seems to be a bug that prevents arc from being used
from the "gulam" shell, but it runs fine from the desktop. For a
command line summary, run 'arc' with no parameters. To view the
contents of an archive, use:

	hv sc_bin.arc


				Enjoy!
