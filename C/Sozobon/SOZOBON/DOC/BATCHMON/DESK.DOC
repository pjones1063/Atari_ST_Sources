
About SC_DESK.ARC... (BATCHMON.TTP, CCD.TTP)

Shortly after the initial release of the public domain Sozobon C compiler,
it became apparent that it didn't work well when run from the GEM desktop
and some command shells (notably PCOMMAND) which force all command line
parameters to uppercase.  Also, the desktop TTP dialog box doesn't allow
for very long command lines.

This archive contains 2 programs, providing a couple different options for
aleviating the aforementioned problems.  As with the rest of the Sozobon 
package, the source code for these programs is included.

Sozobon C includes a program, 'cc', which acts as a driver and calls the
other compiler pieces.  The cc program uses case-sensitive switches, which
doesn't work when run from desktop.  To get around this problem, a variant
of the program (called 'ccd' to distinguish it from the original) has been
created.  This program is functionally similar to the cc program, except
that some switches have been reassigned to prevent case clashes, and it
provides for interactively prompting the user for the input parms to allow
long command lines.  Full documentation is in CCD.ARC.

The second option is a batch monitor program.  A batch monitor is like a
command shell that supports scripts, but not interactive input.  The batch
monitor will not force parms to upper case, so the Sozobon compiler pieces
can be used with the original switch values.  There is some further value
to using the batch monitor instead of 'ccd', in that it gives you greater
control over the compile process, including the ability to redirect some
of the intermediate compiler files to a ramdisk, speeding compilation.  The
tradeoff for this is that it's not as easy to use as 'ccd', requiring you
to provide more control over the process even if you don't want to.  Full
documentation is available in BATCHMON.ARC.

We hope that these hacks will fix the problems people have been
experiencing, at least for now.  The Sozobon authors are totally dedicated
to the concept of command shells, and the person responsible for GEM 
compatibility testing (ME!) didn't do such a hot job.  I have used both of
the programs presented here (indeed, I've been using BATCHMON for years,
it's what caused me to miss the 'cc' problems), and they will allow you to
run the Sozobon compiler from the GEM desktop.  I hope to be building a
graphic shell program (similar to what Personal Pascal has) in the near
future (but don't hold your breath).
