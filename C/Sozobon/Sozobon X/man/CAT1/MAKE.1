        mmaakkee is a tool to build one or more files from other files using
        rules describing the commands how to make a file  from  another.
        Therefore  dependencies are listed in a  mmaakkeeffiillee and in builtin
        rruulleess so that mmaakkee knows which time-stamps of wich files it  has
        to compare.
        This  manual  describes  all  features  and options from Sozobon
        make.  It is not a description of how to use  make  and  writing
        makefiles.   If  you  are  not familiar with make read a general
        make documentation like the  'mmaakkee..ddoocc' from  this  distribution
        or the  GGNNUU make manual.


        TThhee mmaakkeeffiillee

        mmaakkee  looks  at  first  for  a  makefile  named   'MMAAKKEEFFIILLEE', or
        'MMaakkeeffiillee', or 'mmaakkeeffiillee', if there is  none  specified  in  the
        commandline.  This  file has to be in cwd.  mmaakkee will attempt to
        use its internal rules if no makefile exists, but a  target  was
        given on the command line.  This means that simple programs in a
        single file can be made without a makefile by typing:
        	make file.ttp

          iinncclluuddee  
             With the include directive the reading of current  mmaakkeeffiillee
             is  stopped,  all  specified  files  are processed like the
             default  mmaakkeeffiillee , and after that  the  curent    mmaakkeeffiillee
             processing is  continued.   Default targets are never taken
             from an include file!

             iinncclluuddee <ffiillee> [<ffiillee> ...]
             <<file>> may be a  macro,  known  at  this  state,  and  have
             wildcards.    Include  files  are searched like the ones in
             $$MMAAKKEEFFIILLEESS.

             The line continuation character is '\\'.  Back  slashes  may
             appear  in  pathname,  but  NOT at the end of a line, as it
             will be taken as a continuation backslash,  and  not  as  a
             part of  the  pathname.    This  should  not create any big
             problem as far as i can see - just add a space  at  and  of
             line.

        RRuulleess

        If  for  a  target  with  an  extension  (!!)  no  commands  are
        specified, make tries to find an implicit rule that matches this
        target by testing possible dependencies.  The assumed dependency
        is added to the target's dependency list, if it exists.  If not,
        the extension of the assumed dependancy  is  compared  with  the
        first  depandancy  of  the target, if it's the same the matching
        implicit rule will be used  for  this  target.    To  pervent  a
        problem  with  linking  all  dependencies (default rule) and im-
        plicit adding an assumed target, this not added for the  default
        target (if there are any dependencies).  So:
                   foo.ttp:  bar.o x.o y.o 
        will run the linker with the commandline:  
                   cc -o foo.ttp bar.o x.o y.o 
        And not add any dependency 'foo.o'. The imlicit rule used is:
                   .o.ttp:  $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LOADLIBES)
        The implicit rule used for a default target is searched by look-
        ing at  the first dependency's suffix too!  Think of this if you
        specify dependencies with different suffixes!  For  the  default
        target you will have to write your own command(s) in this case.
        The implicit rules are always suffix rules.  So your targets and
        dependencies  must  have  a  suffix  form   '..SSUUFFFFFFIIXXEESS' if they
        should be made with an implicit rule.  You can of course  define
        new implicit rules, or overwrite built-in ones.  Don't forget to
        add the new suffixes to  '..SSUUFFFFIIXXEESS'!

        The  most  important  builtin  rules  are: (you can see all with
        option --pp.)
        	.c.o:
        		$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $<
        
        	.s.o:
        		$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $<
        
        	.c.ttp:
        		$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $< $(LOADLIBES)
        
        	.o.ttp:

        Macros are normally set in the following order:
           	internal defaults
           	environment variables		EXPORTED
           	makefile assignments
        	commandline assignements	EXPORTED
        If the  --ee assignments in the makefile and the order becomes:
           	internal defaults
           	makefile assignments
           	environment variables		EXPORTED
        	commandline assignements	EXPORTED

        Internal (predefined) macros are:
        	PATH = \usr\bin,\bin
        	SHPREFIX = -c
        	CC = cc
        	AR = ar
        	TEX = tex
        	LEX = lex
        	YACC = yacc
        	CFLAGS =
        	LDFLAGS =
        	LOADLIBES =
        	TFLAGS =
        	ARFLAGS =
        	MAKE = make
        	MAKEFLAGS = 
        The macros $(MMAAKKEE) and  $(MMAAKKEEFFLLAAGGSS)  are  set  to  the  values,
        mmaakkee was  invoked  with.    The  --cc and the --ff switch with their
        arguments are of course not inherited into  macro  $(MMAAKKEEFFLLAAGGSS).
        Both  are  not exported by default, but maybe used to run nested
        makefiles and, if you want so, keeping  the  options  the  first
        mmaakkee was started with.

        The  syntax  for  recognizing  a  macro/variable  is:  $$((VAR)) or
        $${{VAR}},, where 'VVAARR' is the variable/macro name.    To  define  a
        variable/macro  in  a  makefile write: '<mmaaccrroo> == <vvaalluuee>' where
        the rest of the line gets the value, skipping leading and trail-
        ing whitespaces.
        A macro/variable is evaluted immediately when found while  read-
        ing  the  makefile, if it is part of another variable's value, a
        target, a dependency or any statement's argument.
        It is evaluated when used, if it is in a commandline in a  rule,
        or in a commandline for an explicit target.
        Special  variables  with  the  syntax  %%((VAR)) or %%{{VAR}} are only
        allowed in dependency lists.  These  variables  make  it  easier
        e.g.   to add a dependency build from the name of the target but
        without the path part there:
        	$(OBJECTS): %(*F).c $(HEADERS)
        		cc -o $(*).o $(*F).c
        This is expanded for every target in $(OBJECTS) to:
        	<pathtarget.suffix>: <target>.c 1.h 2.h ..
        		cc -o pathtarget.o target.c

          eexxppoorrtt  
             Global export: Export all macros  from  makefiles  via  en-
             vironment  to  subsequent processes (nested makes, or other
             child processes).  this directive works only if no unexport
             follows

          eexxppoorrtt   <mmaaccrroo>  ... 
             Export all specified macros as environment variables,  they
             must  not  exist until this directive is read, a global un-
             export does not affect this directive.

          eexxppoorrtt   <mmaaccrroo>  = <value> 
             Defines a macro and makes it exportable at same time.
             Exported macros  are  expanded  before  putting  them  into
             environment!   In  a  subsequent  make  you can use them as
             macros again.

          uunneexxppoorrtt  
             Don't export any macros from any makefile; this is default,
             and resets only a earlier  global  export  directive  (from
             another  included  makefile  perhaps);  the  last export or
             unexport directive is valid

          uunneexxppoorrtt   <mmaaccrroo>  ... 
             Do not export the specified macros, even environment  vari-
             ables  or  commandline  assignements are affected; a global
             export directive does not change the macros' status.

          uunneexxppoorrtt   <mmaaccrroo>  = <value> 
             Define a macro and make it private (usefull if  it  was  an
             environment variable).

          oovveerrrriiddee   <mmaaccrroo>  = value 
             Define  a macro and prevent it from being overwritten; sub-
             sequent assignements to this macro (e.g. from  commandline)
             will  not replace the current value, but be appended to the
             end.

                Dependencies of .PRECIOUS are not deleted if  a  command

          ..SSTTRRIIPPPPAATTHH  
                The  path  part  of every target's name is stripped when
                making the implicit dependency.  This makes it easier to
                compile objects from a sourcecode for different  program
                versions into diffferent directories.  This is some sort
                of a global %%((**FF)) for all inplicit dependencies.

          ..SSHHEELLLL  
                Sets a global switch: all commandlines are passed to the

        You can prefix each commandline in the makefile with one or more
        of the following prefix chars.  The '@@' and '--' prefixes must be
        first ones,  the  excluding  '%%'  and  '!!'  may  follow.   These
        prefixes modify the commandline handling.

          @@  
                Sets the silent switch to this single comandline.

          --  
                Sets the ignore switch to this single comandline.

          !!    
                By default this make executes all commandlines by  self.
                This  prefix  makes mmaakkee to pass this single commandline
                to a shell.  This is an important feature,  cause   mmaakkee
                performs  no  expansions  than wildcard expansion on the
                commandlines.

          %%  
                Forces make to treat the command  in  this  line  as  an
                builtin one.

          $$@@  
                Is  the  current  target  of an implicit rule, or an ex-
                plicit one with multiple targets.  $$((@@FF)) is the filename
                part of  $$@@ , and  $$((@@DD)) the path in  $$@@.

          $$**  
                This the basename of the curent target.  This works only
                if the target has a recognized suffix.    $$((**FF))  is  the
                filename part of  $$** , and  $$((**DD)) the path in  $$**
          $$<<  
                This is the name of the first dependency.  If the target
                got  it's  commands  from an implicit rule, this will be
                the first dependency added by this rule.  $$((<<FF))  is  the
                filename part of  $$<< , and  $$((<<DD)) the path in  $$<<

          $$^^  
                This  macro contains the names of all dependencies, with
                spaces between them.   This  is  useful  for  linking  a
                file.  (See default rules).

          $$??    
                The  names  of  all dependencies that are newer than the
                target, with spaces between them.  This maybe useful  in
                explicit  rules  when  you  want  to  work only with the
                changed files.  For example to update an archive:

        WWiillddccaarrddss

        This make tries to expand  every  token  containing  a  wildcard
        character like:    '**' or  '??' or  '[[' as a filename.  The token
        is replaced by the matching filenames  found.    It  uses  usual
        FNRexpressions as wildcards: '*' '?' '[...]' '[?-?]' '[^...]'

        the value found and use that for command searches  as  described
        above.   With  a  macro assignement in commandline you can over-
        write any macro, from makefile and environment, too.

        If a environment variable  '$$MMAAKKEEFFIILLEESS' exists,  it's  value  is
        used as  a  list of makefiles to include.  The default target is
        never taken from one of  these  files,  but  they  are  read  at
        first.    If  there  are  no  absolut  paths  specified  in  the
        filenames, they are searched in the paths of '$INCLUDEDIR' and a
        directory 'make' in that path.  If there is no environment vari-
        able '$INCLUDEDIR'  or  '$INCLUDE'  (a  list  of  inlude  paths)
        '\usr\include,\usr\local\include' is assumed.

        $$IINNCCLLUUDDEEDDIIRR  This  path  replaces  the builtin search pathes for
        include makefiles not to find in cwd.

        $$IINNCCLLDDUUEE A  list  of  pathes  where  makefiles  to  incldue  are
        searched.  If  $$SSTTDDEERRRR is present, stderr handle (2) is used for
        diagnostic output.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
        mmaakkee  will  claim  about  a  missing target, if there is none in
        commandline or the  makefile.  If it finds a syntax error in the
        makefile it will report this and exit.
