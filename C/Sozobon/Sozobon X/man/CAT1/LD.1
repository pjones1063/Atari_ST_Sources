        The    lldd  command links object modules and libraries to form an
        executable program.  Both object modules and  libraries  may  be
        passed to  ld  for linking.  It can handle DRI, SozobonX objects
        and DRI archives only.

        By default the output is written  to  file    'aa..oouutt',  and  the
        FFaassttllooaadd,  'llooaadd  ttoo  FFaassttRRAAMM' and the  'mmaalllloocc  ffrroomm  FFaassttRRAAMM' pro-
        gram header flags are set.

        Several options may be specified to alter the operation  of  the
        linker:

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
          ----vveerrssiioonn  
          --VV  
             Print detailed Version information to stdout and exit
          ----hheellpp  
          --hh  
             Print the synospsis information (usage) and exit
          --vv    (verbose) 
             Generally show more information about what  lldd is doing and
             print short version information (to stderr).
          --vv22  
             If  you put two  'vv's or a  '--vv22' into commandline  lldd will
             be more verbose, printing the symbols  looked  for  in  the
             libraries,  and  the  extern  symbols  of  the  newly added
             modules from the libraries.
          --BB<<nn>>  
             Increase the limits for internal  buffers  by  factor  <nn>.
             This  option  will be replaced by some automatic allocation
             routines some time.
          --tt    (table) 
             Put a symbol table in the output file.
          --pp    (passes) 
             Make multiple  passes  over  each  library  until  no  more
             references can  be  satisfied.    If  libraries are ordered
             appropriately, this option is not needed and  linking  will
             be faster.
          --ff   <ffiillee>

LD (1)                Sozobon Programmer's Manual                 LD (1)



             This  option  is  useful  when many files are to be linked.
             The loader reads the file <ffiillee> specified for  a  list  of
             object modules  and  libraries  to be linked.  Names in the
             file should be separated by white space or  newlines.    cccc
             will always use this option.
          --oo   <ffiillee>
             By  default,  the  name of the executable file is  'aa..oouutt'.
             This option allows a different name to be specified.
          --uu   <ssyymmbbooll>
             Forces ld to link the symbol  <ssyymmbbooll> at  once  if  it  is
             found in any library module.
             The given  symbol is marked as undefined.  This can be use-
             ful when linking  from  libraries.    And  a  symbol  (e.g.
             ____pprriinnttff)  can  be  marked as undefined to force loading it
             from a library, before another module  (e.g.  from  another
             library) asks for it.
          --bb  
             This  option  can  be  used  when linking large programs to
             reduce the amount of memory used by the loader.  The loader
             makes more disk accesses when this option is used.
          --MM  
          --mm  
             Print a load map.  (I've read anywhere -M is  standard?)  A
             table  of all linked objects with their sizes is printed to
             stdout.
        -L<ppaatthh>
             Add  path  to  the  search  list  to  find  following   (in
             commandline) libraries  and  object  modules.    The pathes
             specified with --LL option are searched first, after cwd  and
             before  builtin  or  $$LLIIBB pathes, in the order specified in
             the commandline.
          ----nnooffllooaadd  
             Do not set Fastload flag in  program  header  of  generated
             executable.
          ----nnooffrraamm  
             Do  not  set  'load  to  FastRAM' flag in program header of
             generated executable.
          ----nnooffmmeemm  
             Do not set 'malloc from FastRAM' flag in program header  of
             generated  executable.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
        $$LLIIBBDDIIRR  This  path  replaces  the  builtin  search  pathes  for
        libraries and object modules not to find in cwd.

        $$LLIIBB A list of pathes where libraries and object modules are  to
        search.   If  this  variable is specified the builtin pathes and
        the  $$LLIIBBDDIIRR path are ignored for searches.

        If  $$SSTTDDEERRRR is present, stderr handle (2) is used for diagnostic
        output.

        1000 global symbols in resulting object (executable)
        400 symbols in every object module
        600 objects in a library (only used for rescanning - multiple passes)
