ld.lzh

szadb.lzh
tools.lzh
top.lzh

	   Archives containing the source code for various parts of the
	   compiler. These should each be unpacked in a subdirectory
	   of the obvious name (e.g. "make.lzh" into directory "make").


These files comprise the source code portion of the Sozobon compiler. To
use the compiler you'll also need the executable portion and a copy of
the runtime library "dLibs" (version 1.2). These should be available
wherever you received this file.

You will also need fplib20 if you want to do floating point code.

The compiler has been self-hosted (i.e. can compile itself) for quite a
while now, so this archive and the executable distribution is all you
need to be able to hack on any part of the system.
