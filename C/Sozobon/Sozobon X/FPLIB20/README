		FLOATING POINT LIBRARY FOR SOZOBON C

		 Rev 2.0 -- prepared April 30, 1989

The files contained in this archive are a set of floating point
functions for Sozobon C.  We provide:

	sqrt		exp		floor
	sin		sinh		modf
	cos		cosh		fmod
	tan		tanh		fabs
	atan		log		ldexp
	atan2		log10		frexp
	asin		pow		atof
	acos		ceil		math.h

and modified versions of:

	fpcmp		fpadd		fpmul
	fpdiv		fp_prt

These are available in source.  There is also a new LIBM.A that has the
new routines included (and the other routines re-arranged to remove the
need to scan the library twice).

The complete archive also contains design notes, release notes for
release 2.0, and a brief set of specifications.

Only LIBM.A and MATH.H are needed for normal use of the library.
LIBM.A should go in your LIB directory, and MATH.H in your INCLUDE
directory.

These routines may be used without restriction, but I retain the copyright
on them, and the Only True Upgrades will be those I make.  If you have any
improvements, please send them to me.
