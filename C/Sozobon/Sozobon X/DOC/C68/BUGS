Bug reports concerning this port of c68 should be send to
rtroskow@jupiter.rz.uni-osnabrueck.de (Thorsten Roskowetz).
Don't bother Keith and Dave Walker with things that may be
completely my fault!  Thank you.


c68/c386 Version 4.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following problems are known to be outstanding in c68/c386 at this
release:

All versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Incorrect code is generated for:

- The *=, /= and %= operators perform incorrect promotions when the LHS is
  an integral value and the RHS is a floating point value.
  Consider the case where i is an int and d is a double.  The expression i *= d
  should be evaluated as if the expressions was i = (int)((double)i * d).
  However the current release evaluates this as i = i * (int)d;


- Adjacent wide string literals are not concatinated.


The following undefined behaviours are not detected:

- An attempt is made to modify a string literal of either form.

- An object is modified more than once, or is modified and accessed other
  than to determine the new value, between two sequence points.

- The value of an uninitialized object that has automatic storage duration
  is used before a value is assigned.



c68 v4.4.4 (TOS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- with option -noopt, sometimes an "& operator on register variable"
  error is reported even if the variable is not declared with storage
  class specifier 'register'; looks like this is a common problem
  with all versions of c68 (Keith, can you confirm this?)

- c68 will always put switch-tables into the text-segment, even with
  option -separate given (see file 'changes')

cc68:
- cannot deal with a list of library paths in $C68LIB
