        makes it possible to gather a large group of object files into a
        single library for ease of use.  It is a standard utility on all
        platforms

        The operation of the selected command can be modified  by  other
        option characters  that  may follow it.  The name of the archive
        to be manipulated follows the option characters.  Some  commands
        also  require  (or  allow)  the names of files in the archive to
        follow the archive name on the  command  line.    The  following
        commands are supported.
