This XdLib distribution additionally contains the libs compiled for 32-bit integer size
and the sizeof()-oparator returning unsigned long. cc (Version 2x05) will select the right
one if called with -mlong or --size-t-long.

A library name looks like
	<libname><i><t><32>.a
where
	libname: the basic library name
	i:       integer library (no floating point support)
	t:       sizeof() type is unsigned long
	32:      sizeof(int)=4, 32-bit int

There is no GEM lib for 32-bit integer.
