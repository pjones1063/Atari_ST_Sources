
Sozobon C Compiler - Version 1.2

This distribution contains an interim release of the Sozobon C compiler.
Included are updated versions of the compiler and optimizer. These can
be used by replacing the corresponding components of the version 1.0
release.

To install this release:

	1. Un-arc the file 'sc_bin12.arc'. It contains the files 'hcc.ttp'
	   and 'top.ttp'.

	2. Copy these files to the location appropriate for your system.

	3. Continue using the compiler as normal.


The new features provided in this release are described in the file
'ver12.txt'. The file 'bugform.txt' is a template to use if you wish to
report bugs to us.

	Also included are a startup module for desktop accessories. To use
it it is necessary to use ld.ttp directly and not cc.ttp as the later uses
dstart.o by default. All that accstart.o does really is to setup the stack
pointer, a stack size of 4096 is forced by could be changed should anyone
so desire. Accstart.o also contains the subroutines for the trap calls as does
dstart.o.
