B: Comments
-----------

  Please note that my FidoNet address has changed to 2:255/355.

  I don't intend to spend much more time working on BinkleyTerm, so that I
  can write my own mailer.  Any proficient C programmer with lots of spare
  time is very welcome to take over development!

  Please send any comments and bugreports NOW to Joerg Spilker on 2:245/96
  or 90:4/0. Version after 3.02a/Beta-7 will come from me until SteVen will 
  be back.

  { 3.03a :          30 December 1992 }
  {___________________________________}______________________________________.
    |
    | 1. Fixed bug which causes a crash when TZ was set in the
    |    environment. All people living west of Greenwich can now
    |    specify a negative offset like GMT-6.
    |
    | 2. Fixed bug which prevents 'immediate call requested' from work
    |    in some cases when using CallSlots.
    |
    | 3. Other handling of Crashmail in events with active CallSlots.
    |    If the event isn't a CM event at the same time, then only
    |    mail to nodes which the proper Slot in the key line is send.
    |    In Beta-8, also Crashmail to other nodes would be send.
    |
    |    A CallSlot for some node will now override a NO_CM capability
    |    of this node. (The same as if you define the M flag for this
    |    event).
    |
    | 4. New fast assembler routines for RS232 handling. It speed up
    |    sending data up to 3000cps (with a normal ST, DTE 38400 baud)
    |    
    |    I hope it works on every configuration (Testet with ST and TT),
    |    because I don't use BIOS-Trap (it makes it very slow) for
    |    RS232. Instead I use the vector on $562 (Bconstat) and
    |    $582 (Bconout).
    |                                         Uwe Zerbe    
    |
    |
    |    Seems to cause some problems with the clock. After a poll of
    |    25 minutes, my clock lost 5 minutes.
    |
    | 5. Modified fax interface to support the QFAX recieve module. You
    |    had to specify some data in your configuration file, which is
    |    then passed to QFAX.
	|
    |    FaxBuffer  <length_in_bytes>
    |
    |    The standard buffer length will be 180000 Bytes. Binkley allocates
    |    the buffer after detecting an incoming fax call.
    |
    |    FaxInbound <path>
    |
    |    Path where QFAX stores the recieved fax images. The default 
    |	 inbound path is the actual directory.
    |
    |	 Modemtype	<number>
    |
    |	 Rmodemtype <number>
    |
    |	 Following numbers are possible for Modemtype 
    |	 (type of fax modem) :
    |
    |	 0 	: SIERRA
    |    1	: PROMODEM
    |	 10 : CLASS2
	|
    |	 Following numbers are possible for RModemtype 
    |
    |	 0	: EXAR
    |	 1	: PROMODEM
    |    10	: CLASS2
    |
    |    Doesn't work in the moment. The RCVFAX program is called properly
    |    but returned with error code -1 which means GENERAL ERROR.
    |
    | 6. NoFullscreen now really works.
    |
    | 7. Calling a node for which you have defined a phone number in the
    |    key lines but with no entry in the nodelist now doesn't show some
    |    curious system name which was left in the nodelist buffer. Instead,
    |    Binkley displays "Unknown BinkleyTerm system".
    |
    | 8. Binkley now takes the correct assumed address when polling nodes.
    |    For example: If you've an address like 51:510/102 and you're
    |    polling 51:501/100, Binkley present your AtariNet address first.
    |
    |    This works in former versions like 3.02a.
    |
    | 9. Compiled with the new PureC update. Like the Lattice version,
    |    this version can now handle CTRL-C keypresses because of the
    |    support of the signal() system call in the PureC update.
    |
    |10. Binkley now also handles JetMail direct mailpackets (named DPT,
    |    DAT, DFT, DRT).
    |    
    |    Changed the handling of direct mail. Older versions of Binkley 
    |    handles direct in the same way as normal. Now direct is something
    |    like immediate. Binkley will send the mail even if no crashmail
    |    event is active and the node hasn't the CM flag set.
    |
    |11. Functionsrequests now also handle IOS Flowfiles QFT and OFT for
    |    sending back files in the same session.
    |
    |12. Fixed bug when using domains in key lines (overwrites parts of 
    |    the internal linked list with the keys).
    |
  {ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ}--------------------------------------.
  { 3.02a/Beta-8 : 17th September 1992}
  {___________________________________}______________________________________.
    |
    | 1. Some Tranx bugs fixed:
    |
    |     a) When matching the polling systems number with the list of
    |        Tranx nodes, the pointnumber of the polling system wasn't
    |        taken into account. If a point of some of the Tranx systems
    |        polled, our system time was set :-(
    |
    |     b) Hopefully, the one/two/or three our difference problem 
    |        is solved. Put a 
    |
    |        TimeZone GMT+x
    |
    |        line into your configuration file. For germany this will be
    |        GMT+2 (and GMT+1 later in the year).
    |        
    |        or set TZ=GMT+x in your environment. 
    |        
    |        Please note, that parsing this line is very stupid. It just 
    |        converts the string after 'GMT+' into a long decimal.
    |
    |        After setting the correct timezone, all times from PC nodes
    |        are two hours in the future. Maybe because the TZ setting on
    |        this systems is not ok. You could put a correction factor in
    |        the Tranx lines for this nodes.
    |        
    |        [+|-]number!node
    |
    |        Example: Tranx 	-2!2:240/36
    |
    | 2. Implemented new feature for controlling polls (better than the  
    |    method with costs and changing the mailflow).
    |    Put the Keyword 'UseCallSlots' into your configuration file. 
    |    But please remember, because i had to use the cost field of
    |    the nodelist structure for this, the cost field in the 
    |    outbound window will be 0 forever.
    |
    |    Put a &x (where x is any alphanumeric character) into the Key lines
    |    after the password:
    |
    |    Key !abcdef &b 90:6000/106.2
    |
    |    Complete your Event file with lines like this:
    |   
    |    Event All 20:00 21:00 S N D A=10 T=2,30 P=string
    |                                            --------
    |    string is a sequence of alphanumeric characters up to 32 chars.
    |
    |    Now in the above event, Binkley will only call those nodes with &x 
    |    character matches one of the characters in the 'string'. 
    |
    |	 IMPORTANT NOTE: All systems with no &x definition (usually the rest of
    |                    the nodelist) will not be polled for normal mail.
    |
    |    Because the format of the BINKLEY.SCD file has changed, all forced events
    |    will be started again when using Beta-8. It is a good idea to delete
    |    an existing BINKLEY.SCD file before running this version.
    |
    |
    | 3. Added feature to call a fax recieving program when the modem responses
    |    CONNECT FAX or FCON. The program to call is defined by the configuration
    |    entry:
    |
    |    Fax full_path_and_name_of_program
    |
    |    The check is done before strings for the external mailer
    |    interface are checked. This should solve problems with 
    |    the MNP_Filter who seems to filter also the "ZyXel" string
    |    send by this modems after the CONNECT FAX message.
    |
    |    Note: At the moment, no fax programs seems to be able to
    |          deal with an active carrier. 
    |
    |    Because i've an USR DS this feature isn't tested!!
    |
    | 4. DIAL statement now works as the DIAL statement in parselist.
    |    Default DIAL translation is the last DIAL line!!
    |
    | 5. HoldOnUs/ReqOnUs/NoEmsi is now active for ALL nodes if no
    |    list is specified (as in versions before).
    |

  { 3.02a/Beta-7 : 8th August 1992    }
  {___________________________________}______________________________________.
    |                                                                        |
    | 1. Tranx bug fixes:                                                    |
    |     a) System time set correctly.                                      |
    |     b) Time sent to other system should be correct, before it was      |
    |        two hours out.  I think some og this might be cause by a        |
    |        problem with the PureC libraries being hard wired to GMT+1      |
    |                                                                        |
  {ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ}--------------------------------------.
  { 3.02a/Beta-6 : 15th May 1992      }
  {___________________________________}______________________________________.
    |                                                                        |
    | 1. Key statement doesn't care what order its parameters are given.     |
    |                                                                        |
    | 2. Nodelist searching is more flexible with keys.  If you have more    |
    |    than one key that matches the node then the values from several may |
    |    be combined in the result, for example if you have the keys:        |
    |      Key !HELLO     2:123/456                                          |
    |      Key !BYE       3:321/987                                          |
    |      Key %0123-4567 2:123/456                                          |
    |      Key #2:100/0   2:*                                                |
    |      Key #2:100/101 *                                                  |
    |                                                                        |
    |    Then looking up 2:123/456 will result in:                           |
    |      password = HELLO                                                  |
    |      phone    = 0123-4567                                              |
    |      assumed  = 2:100/0                                                |
    |                                                                        |
    |    Looking up 3:321/987 will result in:                                |
    |      password = BYE                                                    |
    |      phone    = taken from nodelist                                    |
    |      assumed  = 2:100/101                                              |
    |                                                                        |
    |    Looking up 1:222/333 will result in:                                |
    |      password = from nodelist                                          |
    |      phone    = from nodelist                                          |
    |      assumed  = 2:100/101                                              |
    |                                                                        |
	| 3. Manually polling a non-CM node with Alt-M outside of Mailing Hour   |
    |    will prompt the user to confirm whether they really want to poll    |
    |    the system.                                                         |
    |                                                                        |
    | 4. A bug was fixed in the nodelist cache, which caused the wrong       |
    |    assumed address to be presented to the remote caller in many cases. |
    |                                                                        |
    | 5. File requests will stop searching once a file is found if the       |
    |    request does not contain a wildcard                                 |
    |                                                                        |
    | 6. tranx field can be used to update your system clock.  To do this    |
    |    a new configuration word has been added:                            |
    |                                                                        |
    |      tranx <list of nodes>                                             |
    |                                                                        |
    |    The list of nodes is in the same format as that used by HoldsOnUs   |
    |    and may include wildcards, etc.                                     |
    |                                                                        |
    |    If during an EMSI session and the remote system has a TRX# field    |
    |    and their *primary* address matches the list of nodes, then the     |
    |    time of your machine will be set to the value given in the tranx    |
    |    data.  You might want to enable this, if you know for example that  |
    |    another system has their clock updated by an atomic clock receiver. |
    |    Note that due to the time involved in the EMSI handshake, it might  |
    |    be a second or two out.                                             |
    |                                                                        |
    |    Both the BIOS and GEMDOS clocks are updated                         |
    |                                                                        |
    |    I had a few problems with times being an hour out.  I think the     |
    |    problems might be to do with Pure C being hard coded for Central    |
    |    European Time, but anyway, I think I have got it sorted out by      |
    |    using the ANSI gmtime() function instead of localtime().            |
    |                                                                        |

    |    shorter/quicker executables                                         |
    |                                                                        |
    | 2. Added support for Daniel Roesen's BTNC nodelist format.  A new      |
    |    keyword has been added:                                             |
    |                                                                        |
    |      BTNC                                                              |
    |                                                                        |
    |      Uses the *.BNL format nodelists as created by Daniel Roesen's     |
    |      BTNC nodelist compiler instead of the default version 6 nodelist  |
    |      produced with ParselST.                                           |
    |                                                                        |
    |    The BTNC nodelist has some advantages in that points can be used    |
    |    without having to fiddle with fakenet addresses.  It also allows    |
    |    several domains to be combined in one set of files.                 |
    |                                                                        |
    | 3. Added a Nodelist cache.  This certainly speeds things up.  What it  |
    |    does is to store the information about a node when it is accessed   |
    |    avoiding the slow nodelist searching and disk access.  The size of  |
    |    the cache is configurable using a new keyword:                      |
    |                                                                        |
    |      NodeCache <size>                                                  |
    |                                                                        |
    |      Sets the size of the Nodelist Cache to <size> entries.  Each      |
    |      entry represents one address and occupies 146 bytes of memory.    |
    |      the default value is 16 taking up 2336 bytes.                     |
    |                                                                        |
    |      Setting <size> to 0, will disable the cache.                      |
    |                                                                        |
    |    Whenever a node is looked up in the nodelist it is added to the     |
    |    cache.  If the cache is full then the entry that has not been       |
    |    accessed for the longest will be removed to make way for the new    |
    |    one.  I'll see how this works and maybe use a different algorithm   |
    |    to pick which one to lose if it seems necessary.                    |
    |                                                                        |
    |    A good size seems to be a few more than however many nodes there    |
    |    are in your outbound area.                                          |
    |                                                                        |

    |                                                                        |
    | 1. Speeded up NodeList reading some more by sorting the lists of nets  |
    |    in each zone and using a binary search.  The list of zones is also  |
    |    sorted.                                                             |
    |                                                                        |
    | 2. Failed file requests will display more information in the log about |
    |    the reason for failure... i.e what the time limit was, etc.         |
    |                                                                        |
    | 3. Fixed a bug in the nodelist search that crashed when the 1st net    |
    |    in a zone was accessed                                              |
    |                                                                        |
    | 4. Recompiled with a new version of PureC.  Its about 2K shorter, but  |
    |    I don't know what effects it will have.                             |
    |                                                                        |
    | 5. Added multiple nodelist handling.  All the IDX's for every domain   |
    |    will be loaded when needed and left in memory instead of having to  |
    |    be reread every time the domain changed.                            |
    |                                                                        |
    |    Note that the configuration command:                                |
    |       NewNodeList                                                      |
    |    has been removed since it serves no useful purpose any more.        |
    |                                                                        |
    | 6. "TRX#" display has been changed to "Tranx:" instead.                |
    |                                                                        |

    | 1. Fixed problem with nodelist reading whereby all zones weren't read  |
    |    properly.  Apologies to anyone who received beta-1 already.         |
    |                                                                        |

    |                                                                        |
    | 1. Added new command Line Option for batch mode:                       |
    |                                                                        |
    |      CONNECT <connect string>                                          |

    |    The intended use for this is when BinkleyTerm-ST is called in       |
    |    BATCH mode then the calling program should pass the modem's         |
    |    connect string to BinkleyTerm so that BinkleyTerm can know what     |
    |    the baud rate is and work out such things as whether or not to      |
    |    allow Janus connections.                                            |
    |                                                                        |
    |    Example...                                                          |
    |                                                                        |

    | 2. Zmodem turnaround during EMSI has been modified.  This should cure  |
    |    the problems with TrapDoor!                                         |
    |                                                                        |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    | 3. Added new configuration Keywords:                                   |
    |                                                                        |
    |     Rbuf size                                                          |
    |     Tbuf size                                                          |
    |                                                                        |
    |    These set the size of the RS232 buffers in a more convenient manner |
    |    than the previous method of using environment variables.            |
    |                                                                        |
    |    Environment variables may still be used, but these configuration    |
    |    options take priority.                                              |
    |                                                                        |
    |    If neither configuration words or environment variables are defined |
    |    then the default buffers are used.  On a standard ST these will be  |
    |    quite small, but if you are using an RS232 patch such as 4KBUF or   |
    |    HS_FIX then the buffers used by them will remain in use by          |
    |    BinkleyTerm.                                                        |
    |                                                                        |
    |    Example...                                                          |
    |                                                                        |

    |                                                                        |

    |                                                                        |
    | 4. Updated Function Requests + and $                                   |
    |                                                                        |
    |    If the caller is a point then the point will be added to the        |
    |    commands generated from these requests.                             |
    |                                                                        |
    |    With $ you may now put up to 3 "%d" in the command and the last     |
    |    one is substituted by the point number.                             |
    |                                                                        |
    |    With + the point number is added to the end unless it is zero.      |
    |                                                                        |

    | 5. EMSI HAT (Hold All Traffic) marks that node as uncallable to        |
    |    prevent it from being called again.                                 |
    |                                                                        |

    | 6. EMSI aka's are displayed in log and on screen in lines like:        |
    |      aka: 1:234/56 2:345/678.12                                        |

    | 7. EMSI TRX# field is dislayed.  This is just a hexadecimal            |
    |    representation of the time while the EMSI packet is created.  I     |
    |    don't know what it is for or what to do with it, but people have    |
    |    asked me to process it, so I have done so.                          |
    |                                                                        |
    |    It is displayed as:                                                 |
    |      Trx#: 29F2BB28 / 29F2BB30                                         |

    |    The 1st number is provided by the remote.  The 2nd is the time on   |
    |    our system and is also sent to the remote.                          |

    | 8. Speeded up the Nodelist and outbound reading                        |
    |                                                                        |
    |    This began as an attempt to speed up the outbound area reading      |
    |    time, but it soon became clear that most of the time was actually   |
    |    in looking up nodes in the nodelist rather than scanning the        |
    |    outbound packets!                                                   |
    |                                                                        |
    |    I have completely rewritten the nodelist module to use my own       |
    |    own sorted nodelist tree structure in memory instead of the raw     |
    |    NODELIST.IDX.  The result is a lot less time searching through the  |
    |    IDX array.  I can if neccessary speed it up some more, but that     |
    |    will have to wait till another day.                                 |
    |                                                                        |
    |    In addition, I changed file access to use Gemdos directly instead   |
    |    of via the C Libraries, again increasing a dramatic speed increase  |
    |                                                                        |
    |    On my system it speeded up the outbound reading to 58% of the time  |
    |    it used to take.                                                    |
    |                                                                        |
    |    It's also a good idea to unfragment your NODELIST.IDX and           |
    |    NODELIST.DAT files after producing them with ParselST.  You can do  |
    |    this by moving them both to a different partition and back again.   |
    |                                                                        |
