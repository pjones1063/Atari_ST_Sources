Hello Helmut und Joerg,

Some days ago I've send a netmail to Helmut and told him that binkley can not 
receive more than one fax in one call. This is still the matter.

But.... RCVFAX.TTP can receive more than one fax in one call. So the external 
and the one buildin in binkley are not the same!

As off binkley 3.10 beta-1 it's not possible anymore to install an external 
faxreceiver. When I use the keyword with the parameters:

FaxPrg RCVFAX.TTP 2

then binkley will respond with the text:

Unknown or illigal configline: FagPrg RCVFAX.TTP 2

Regards, Harrie.

I've took the fax from our work and installed it near my zyxel. I've send tree 
pages and received it on my atari with qfax-pro-4. Everything wend well. I 
received all the tree pages on my harddisk and viewed them.

Then I did the same test with binkley 3.10 beta-1. Only the first page was 
received. The other two were send from the confesional fax, but only with the 
first page the receive-led on the zyxel was flickering. The receive-led on the 
zyxel didn't flicker with the next pages. There was only one fax in the 
faxinbound received.

Resume:
1. The zyxel can receive more than one faxpage.
2. Do you read the data of the rs232 in your program for the seccond and
   more pages? It is obvious there is a bug in your program.
3. What will happen if the next faxpage will be received in the same
   minute? Your program stores the pages on the disk in the format:
   FRmounthdayhour.Fminute. Wouldn't it be better to change this in:
   mounthdayhourminute.Fnumber?

If you need a propper beta-tester for your tool, I like to assist you in this 
matter.

Mit freundliche Grusse, Harrie.
