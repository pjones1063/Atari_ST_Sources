
* More packing speed (still working on it) I need user feed back to
  get enough inspiration, write me! (done, can still use inspiration!)

* Multiple volume support (done)

* Implementation of -jm switch (best compression) (done!)

* Implementation of mode 8, using a 64k sliding dictionary for better
  compression especially on text files. (Compare mode 1 and mode 7.
  They use same algorithms, but mode 1 has a 26k dictionary and mode
  7 has a 32k dictionary.)

* Support all ARJ options

* Decent user interface (both commandline and shell)

* Option for depacking files in a folder but not if there is only
  one file in the archive.

* Auto depacking files

* TOS-CREW ultra pack mode (and still compatible) (far future, cool idea
  from Chainsaw) (wait for -~t option!)

* Conversion to other 68000 platforms (Mac, Amiga)

* Conversion to other non-MS DOS platforms (Unix, Linux, OS2,
  Archimedes, AIX, VMS, Solaris etc... (please send machines with
  C-compiler and documentation. PowerPC's are very welcome,
  I'd like to try DEC Alpha machines too ;-) ))

* MS DOS version with atari bombs! (chipswinger) (very low priority)
