A note for those who don't know Bermuda
---------------------------------------

Bermuda is a FidoNet compatible mail processing software. It was
originally written for the Atari ST by Jac Kersing. It has been
updated and ported to Unix by Franck Arnaud and me.

This version (1.22) of Bermuda includes the original documentation from
version 1.00 (bermuda.doc) and an update documentation (update.doc).

This software is provided "as is" without expressed or implied warranty.


Compiling Bermuda on Atari
--------------------------

Use Turbo C or Pure C with the supplied *.prj files.
Check that you have #define STTC 1 in pandora.h


Compiling Bermuda on Unix
-------------------------

Note that depending on how you get this source code, all the files may
be ending with CR-LF, a la MS-DOS. Your compiler may not like that.

You will need an Ansi compiler, I used GCC. 
Check that you have #define UNIX 1 in pandora.h

If your library don't have the strdup function, define MSTRDUP in the Makefile,
same if you miss the strupr function, define MSTRUPR.

All configuration files (areas.bbs, bermuda.rte, bermuda.cfg) are in
lower case, while everything else is in uppercase (.MSG, .HDR, .PKT).
Bermuda also accepts packets in lowercase (*.pkt).

As with the Atari ST, the MAILER environment variable define the directory
where areas.bbs and bermuda.cfg (or tb.cfg) resides.

In the parameters of arcmail etc, %: is replaced by a ';', and %k by
the packet name without path. This may be useful when running Unix.
Suggested zip configuration under Unix is

zipunpack      cd %d %: unzip %n
zippack        cd %d %: zip -m %n %k

with zip and unzip anywhere in the path.

An unfixed bug requires (at least on my computer) that you run
import and pack from the directory where you put areas.bbs and
bermuda.cfg.


Doing Fido on Unix
------------------

If you want to play fido on Unix, here is the list of the currently
software that I know of :

Bermuda 1.22,	this is what you have and is suited for use with
		Binkley/Bed/LazyBBS.

Binkley 3.02,	this is the mailer, ported from the Atari ST version by
		Ben Stuyts (2:281/202.6 or benstn@olivetti.nl). It does
		EMSI and runs well with Bermuda. Latest version should
		be on 2:281/202. At this date running on BSD (NeXT, Sony...)
		systems and Linux.

ParseLst 1.33,	this is the nodelist compiler for use with Binkley,
		I made a few patch so that the MS-DOS version compile
		on my Unix computer.

LazyBBS,	this is a menu-driven BBS running with the Bermuda
		message base. All the menus and texts are configurable
		(a la QuickBBS).
LazyFix,	this is an areafix, to allow node/points to automatically
		connect or disconnect some areas.
LazyTick,	this is a file mailer, for handling file distribution
		network.
Pof,		this program builds a list of all available files.

For all Lazy and Pof, contact Franck Arnaud (2:320/100) or franck@altsoft.demon.co.uk.

BloufGate,	this is a Fido/Usenet gateway package, it converts
		uucp packets to FidoNet packets and vice versa, gating
		netmail and echomail. Contact bloufgate@altsoft.demon.co.uk

Bed,		this is a message editor (whose interface is largely
		taken from the Led editor on Atari ST) for a Bermuda
		message base. It is running under X/Windows and Motif.
		Contact vincent@stell.frmug.fr.net
		

All these programs are available for file request on 2:320/100, and should
be available via ftp anonymous on ftp.ieee.org.
