         Section 1    GENERAL INFORMATION




         Bermuda is a set of programs for processing  Fidonet  style 
         messages. It uses an own messagebase format to store message. 
         This  format  is  know  as 'Pandora/The  Box'  format  or  is 
         sometimes referred to as 'QuickBBS' message base.  The format 
         is  however  not the same as the 'QuickBBS'  format  used  on 
         MS-DOS  computers.  This  messagebase is however  a  kind  of 
         standard  for  the Atari ST line  of  computers.  Almost  all 
         mailprocessors use this format.

         Bermuda  was  developed for tht The Box mailer.  But  can  be 
         used with other mailers too (e.g. Binkley ST).

         This reference guide is just what it is,  a reference. If you 
         want  to know more about fidonet and communication  then  you 
         might find the user guide of Binkley ST, the documentation of 
         QuickBBS ST and some other Fidonet documents usefull.
         There  also  exist standard  technical  documentation  about 
         Fidonet called the FTS and FTSC documents. You should be able 
         to get them at the larger fidonet nodes.



         About the Fidonet:

         I still need to tell you something about Fidonet so lets  go. 
         Fidonet consists of several nodes.
         Your nodenumber: for example 2:283/333.0

         2:   Zone,   2 is Europe, 1 USA, 3 Australia etc.
         283/ Net,    a net is a part of a country. A country is called a 
                      region and consists mostly of several nets.
                      For example 280 to 286 are The Netherlands which is 
                      called Region 28.
         /333  Node,  this is the BBS or mail system.  It is  open  to 
                      callers and other mail systems depending on it's 
                      setup.
         .0   Point,  this is a single user. He uses Fidonet software to 
                      get  and read mail.  He is the lowest  part  of 
                      Fidonet.


          The basic structure is:

                   Host-----------Host
                   /  \
                  HUB  HUB
                  /  \
               Node Node
               /  \
            Point  Point

         This  is  the basic structure  although  connections  between 
         systems also exist. A Node is also referred to as BOSS if  he 
         has any points under him.
         
         
         How does bermuda work.

         Bermuda consist of 3 basic programs:

         Import, Scan and Pack

         Import:

         Import  imports  messages  that  are  recieved  from  another 
         Fidonet  system.  Import  looks in your inbound  or  incoming 
         files  directory for mail packets.  If found it will  extract 
         the messages from it. A normal packet is called 12345678.PKT, 
         the name can be almost anything, the extension is always PKT.
         An archived mail packet has a different extension,  it is the 
         day of the week with a number: .MO1, .WE2 ,  meaning  :Monday 
         packet 1,  and wednesday packet 2.  You don't need to  bother 
         with this,  import will. Import will call ARC.TTP if it finds 
         an archived packet.  When unarchived it will import  all  PKT 
         files.  It  will determine what the  messages  are:  Netmail, 
         Echomail  or trash.  The file AREAS.BBS is used to  see  what 
         areas  there  are and where  to place  the  messages.  Import 
         will also look in the areas.bbs to see if echomail has to  be 
         send  to other systems and will forward echomail messages  if 
         needed.

         Scan:

         Scan  will scan your local messagebase for message  that  are 
         entered locally, by you or your users of your BBS.
         It will then export and forward the echomail messages to  the 
         systems listed in the areas.bbs for that particular area.

         Pack:

         Both scan and import can and will forward echomail,  they can 
         place  those forwarded messages either in netmail  (slow  and 
         diskspace  consuming)  or  put them  directly  in  PKT  files 
         (faster  and less diskconsuming).  Pack will look for packets 
         and  call ARC.TPP to archive them.  Pack will also scan  your 
         netmail  areas  and  forward any messages  that  need  to  be 
         forwarded. For this Pack also needs a Route file (BERMUDA.RTE 
         or  TB.RTE)  where you tell pack how and where and  via  what 
         route to send mail.

         Oke got that? Hope so if not ASK your Host,Sysop,Boss etc.

         Before you start installing your software you should ask your 
         Host,Sysop,Boss etc.  for your nodenumber and other  relevant
         information.


         The configuration file.


         Bermuda needs a configuration file so it knows who it is  and 
         what it should do. This file is called BERMUDA.CFG or if that 
         does not exists TB.CFG (from The Box).

         The  configuration file consists of keywords that are  listed 
         here.  If you place a semi colon (;) in front of a line it is 
         considered to be a comment line and is ignored.

         The keywords here are only needed for Bermuda, if you use The 
         Box you should read that manual too as The Box needs many more 
         keywords.



         ADDRESS zone:net/node.point [fakenet]

               This  statement (or several if  you  have  several 
               nodenumbers)  is the nodenumber issued by your Host  or 
               Boss (in cases you'r a point). A Node should use .0 for 
               the pointnumber.

               There is one optional number and that is  your  fakenet 
               in case you are a point or you are a node with  points. 
               The fakenet is a small trick because Fidonet is not all 
               4D (4 dimensional, for points). The fakenet is supplied 
               by your region coordinator.  It is very important to do 
               this the right way.  Also your fakenet may not show  up 
               in  messages.  If  you use the fakenet  statement  then 
               Bermuda  will  expand  all  fakenet  addresses  in   4D 
               addresses.


               Example:  ADDRESS 2:282/301.2 6301


         APPLICATION <anything>
 
               Ignored  by The Box and Bermuda.  May be used by  other 
               programs to store information in the config file.

               Example:  APPLICATION Logreader c:\tb\tb.log


         HOLD <path>

               This is the path to your outbound mail area.  Here  are 
               the mail packets stored that are to be send. Do NOT use 
               the  directory yourself it is for Bermuda and  The  Box 
               only!

               Example:  HOLD C:\TB\OUTBOUND\



         KEY [#id] [!password] nodenumber <nodenumber...>

               With  KEY you specify the password(s) you use with  the 
               system you exchange mail with. This password is used by 
               The  Box for mailsessions and Bermuda puts it into  the 
               mailpackets.

               Example:  KEY !JAC 2:283/333.0

               Means:  use  JAC as mailsession and packet pasword  for 
               283/333.0

               With the #id parameter you can alter your address for a 
               particular node.  Usefull when using alternets or being 
               multipoint.  Bermuda will change  the from field and the 
               number  in the origin to the ID for mail that  is  send 
               to the nodes you mention after #id. 

               Example: KEY #90:100/100.0 90:101/333.0

               This  will  alter  your From field  and  nodenumber  in 
               echomail  to  90:100/100.0  for mail that  is  send  to 
               90:101/333.0. Please note that you also need to make an 
               address  line for 90:100/100.0 as this is  your  number 
               for zone 90.  You can also use 90:ALL,  this means  all 
               nodes for zone 90. 

               Example: KEY #90:100/100.0 90:ALL

               Your system will use 90:100/100.0 for ALL 90 zone nodes.


         LOGLEVEL <nr.>

               Loglevel  to  be  used.   1  gives  the  most  detailed 
               information and 6 the lowest

               Example:  LOGLEVEL 1
               



         NETFILE <path>

               Path to area for incoming mail and files.  Your  mailer 
               puts  all  incoming files here.  The  *.PKT  files  and 
               *.MO?, *.TU?, *.WE?, *.TH?, *.FR?, *.SA?, *.SU? are the 
               archived mail packets. You should not fiddle with those 
               that's import's task.

               Example:  NETFILE C:\TB\INBOUND\



         NETMAIL <path>

               This  points to your netmail area.  Use full  path  and 
               name  but use NO extension.  Filenames should be max  8 
               characters but you can also use numbers. They should be 
               always 4 digits: 0001

               Example: NETMAIL C:\TB\NETMAIL
               or:      NETMAIL C:\TB\0001



         STATUSLOG <file>

               The name and path of your logfile

               Example:  STATUSLOG C:\TB\TB.LOG
               


         SYSOP <name>

               The name of the sysop.

               Example:  SYSOP Jac Kersing


         Commandline options

         You  can  specify several options on the commandline  of  the 
         Bermuda utils. This is very important.

         IMPORT:

         -A <string>

               Define  the archiver to use.  Default import  and  pack 
               search for ARC.TTP in the Bermuda directory.

               Example:  -A c:\tb\whatarc.ttp x
         

         -G    RESERVED DO NOT USE


         -I    RESERVED DO NOT USE


         -K    Keep arcmail packets. Import renames them.


         -P    Export message directly to packets.  If you are a  node 
               that  is  also sending mail to other systems or if  you 
               have  points you should use this.  Mail for  the  other 
               systems is then directly put into a packet so that Pack 
               only needs to archive them

         -R    If used once mail is only tossed if the sender is  also 
               mentoined in the areas.bbs for that particlar area.  If 
               used twice then the password in the mail packet is also 
               checked.

         -S    Ask  for  packetname,  for manual  processing  of  mail 
               packets.


         -T    Write to the logfile.


         -V    Verbose logging.  May be used several times but once is 
               usually enough.


         SCAN:


         -G    RESERVED DO NOT USE

         -K    RESERVED DO NOT USE

         -M n  Write a maximum of n echomail messages.

         -P    Same as with import

         -Q    Quite mode, only gives limited information on the screen

         -T    Same as with import


         PACK:

         -A    Same as with import

         -S    To start an IF statement in the route file.  Read  that 
               part of the documentation for more info.

         -T    Same as with import


         Routing of mail

         This part is about how and where to send mail to.

         The first important file is the AREAS.BBS file.  In this file 
         you put the names and paths of the echomail areas you receive 
         and send. So the systems that get the mail areas from you are 
         also mentioned here.

         The  file  AREAS.BBS  must be in the same  directory  as  the 
         Bermuda package is in and/or the environment variable  MAILER 
         points to.
         The  first line of the areas.bbs is the default origin  line. 
         This  is  the  line  that  scan  puts  under  every  echomail 
         messages:

         * Origin Jac's mailbox system (2:283/333)

         Scan puts the nodenumber behind it itself. You must take care 
         that  the  origin line is not longer than  1  line.  Take  in 
         account  the  length of the * Origin  and  nodenumber.
         The next lines are the areas. Example:

         Jac's mailbox system
         c:\thebox\msgs\0001 MAIL
         c:\thebox\msgs\0002 ATARIST 2:283/3
         c:\thebox\msgs\0003 THE-BOX 2:283/3

         Lines beginning with a semicolon (;) will be  ignored.  Every 
         line consists of:

         Areapath Fidonet-name Nodenumber(s)

         The  filename  should not have an extension as it  is  stored 
         like  c:\tb\msgs\0001.hdr and c:\tb\msgs\0001.msg  where  the 
         *.HDR  file  is the header file and *.MSG  contains  the  raw 
         messagetext. The filename can be anything you like but we use 
         numbers (always 4 digits!) to make it more clear.
         The  second parameter is the name of the area,  this must  be 
         the official Fidonet name.
         The third and following parameters are the nodenumbers of the 
         systems from where you recieve the area from and/or you  send 
         the  area  to.  Points can be displayed like  .2  instead  of 
         2:283/333.2 so they take less room.

         There   are  a  couple  of  special  areanames  (the   second 
         parameter):

         MAIL     For the netmail areas,  no nodenumers allowed  after 
                  this!
         BADMSGS  Bad  messages,  all corrupted messages are put  into 
                  here, wrongly addressed messages stay in the netmail 
                  area.
         LOCAL:   This  is for areas you only have locally  and  that 
                  should not be send.  Scan skips these.  You must not 
                  place  any nodenumbers after this name.  Every  area 
                  that  does not have any nodenumbers after it's  name 
                  is considered a 'local' area.

                  Example: LOCAL:SYSOPMAIL.

         There  are  also a couple of special  options.  You  can  put 
         BEFORE  every  area  a line beginning with  -  (minus).The  - 
         (minus) indicates that this is a special option. An example:

         Jac's mailbox system
         c:\thebox\msgs\0001 MAIL
         -DAYS 12
         c:\thebox\msgs\0002 ATARIST 2:283/3
         -ORIGIN Jac's box
         c:\thebox\msgs\0003 THE-BOX 2:283/3

         The -DAYS was used for comscan,  which is not in use anymore, 
         but  some  other crunchers or packers use  this.  A  cruncher 
         deletes  messages marked for deletion.  The -DAYS is used  to 
         delete older messages then 12 days.  This option is not  used 
         by  the  Bermuda   package,  but is  allowed  as  some  other 
         crunchers may be able to use it. The -DAYS 12 is ment for the 
         area ATARIST in this case.

         The  -ORIGIN is used to change the default origin  line  (the 
         first line in the areas.bbs) for the next area.  So the  area 
         THE-BOX  will not show 'Jac's mailbox system' in  the  origin 
         but 'Jac's box'.  This way you can define a different  origin 
         for  every area.  You migh want to use different origins  for 
         national areas and international areas.




          The TB.RTE file:

         This  is  more complex.  In this file you  tell  the  Bermuda 
         package how to route (send) mail and via which paths.

         In  TB.RTE  we use wildcards,  so first a small  piece  about 
         that:

         WILDCARDS:

         The '*' and '?' are the so called wildcards.  They are almost 
         the  same  as in most commandline interpreters.  So  '*'  can 
         replace any sequence of zero or more charcters,  and '?'  can 
         replcae any single character.  Unlike other programs  however 
         the packer DOES take characters after '*' into  account.  So, 
         'P*' or 'P*K' can replace PACK, but 'P*X' can not.
         In  this  way  nodenumbers  are  treated,  '2:*'  applies  to 
         2:283/333  so  does '2:2*3,  but '2:?2*' or '2:*4'  does  not 
         apply. There is a special notation for points, see POINTS.


         KEYWORDS:

         Keywords  can  be divided into three  different  groups.  the 
         first  one  applies to message handling,  the second  one  to 
         packets, and the third to the route file itself.


         Group 1

         ROUTE-TO [CRASH] [FILE] <node> <nodes>

               Messages for <nodes> are sent to <node>.

         NO-ROUTE [CRASH] [FILES] <nodes>

               Messages for <nodes> are sent directly.                  

         FORWARD-FROM [CRASH] [FILE] <nodes1> TO <nodes2>

               Messages from <nodes1> to <nodes2> are routed. Messages
               from or to other nodes are not routed.  They  stay  on 
               your system.


         Group 2

         ARCMAIL <nodes>

               Mail to <nodes> is arced.
               This  shold  only be used if you  are  sure  that  the 
               recieving node accepts arcmail.



         HOLD <nodes>

               Normal mail to <nodes> is not sent.  Packets are put on 
               hold to be taken by the recieving node when it  calles 
               you.

         POLL <nodes>

                Call <nodes> for mail,  also when you have nothing  to 
                send.

         REDIRECT [CRASH] <node> <nodes>

                Packets for <nodes> are sent to <node>
                This can be done only if these packets are not arced.


         Group 3


         IF <tag>

               Line after this line are processed only if -S <tag> is
               put on the commandline of pack.  Processing  continues 
               until the next IF or the end of the route file.
                
               Example: Pack -S poll

               (TB.RTE):

               ARCMAIL 283/3

               ROUTE-TO 283/3 *

               IF POLL
               POLL 283/3

               If -S poll is used the command's after the IF POLL  are 
               used, in this case the system will start polling 283/3.


         Other keywords are: OURNET, BOSS, POINTS and ALL



         POINTS:

         For sysops:
         Points  must be specified by .<number> and not by their  full 
         address. Use of that is illegal.

         For points:
         The  route  file for points is quite  simple.  For  a  single  
         point:

         ARCMAIL BOSS
         ROUTE-TO BOSS ALL

         will do. If crashmail should be routed to the boss 

         ROUTE-TO CRASH BOSS ALL
         can be added.

         Multi points should add
         NO-ROUTE <zone>:<net>/<node>
         for all bosses expect for their first.


         ADVANCED TOPICS:

         This is where it gets complicated..

         What would you think of:

         ROUTE-TO 2:2/$1 *:*
         NO-ROUTE 2:*


         This line takes care of zone routing. All in one line!
         Well allright,  we need the second line to keep messages from 
         our own zone here. They are routed normally.
         Want to understand it? We will try to explain it then.


         Let's start at the beginning:
         Pack  reads a message containing a source and  a  destination 
         address.  First it checks if the source address is  ours.  If 
         not the program checks for FORWARD-FROM ..  TO ..  to see  if 
         the  message  can  be routed.  If a crash  message  can't  be 
         processed  by  a FORWARD-FROM CRASH line it's  crash  bit  is 
         reset and the message is routed as a normal one.

         If  a message can be send after these checks the  destination 
         address  is read and converted to a  character  string,  like 
         '2:283/333'.  This  string  is used to check  for  applicable 
         lines that can be used to process the message. A line applies 
         if  the nodenumbers match.  If a string  has  wildcards,  all 
         wildcards  are  replaced  by  the  strings  they  match.  So, 
         '2:283/333'  is  matched  by '2:*/*' the  first  wildcard  is 
         translated  to 283 and the other to 333.  These  translations 
         can be used in the first node number after ROUTE-TO.  You can 
         use them by using $x (x=1..9) in the nodenumber,  where x  is 
         the  number of the wildcard counting left to right.  In  this 
         example $1 translates to 283 and $2 to 333.
         You should take care that there are enough wildcards to match 
         these $x.
         Translations of unmatched $x will give unpredictable results.

         In  the  example we started with $1 translating to  the first 
         wildcard which is the zonenumber.  So messages to other zones 
         are routed to 2:2/<zone>

         The is another example:

         ROUTE-TO 28$1/0 28?/*

         Now  a  message to 283/333 is sent to  283/0,  a  message  to 
         282/301 to 282/0 and so on. A missing part of a nodenumber is 
         replaced  by the value of the corresponding part of your  own 
         private number.  In our setup both 283/333 and 282/301  apply 
         to zone 2.

         The use of MAGIC WORDS in lines that contain '$x@ expressions 
         can lead to unpredictable results. Please don't use them.

         In normal lines MAGIC WORDS have the following translation:

         ALL     *
         OURNET  <ourzone>:<ournet>/*
         BOSS    <bosszone>:<bossnet>/<bossnode>
         POINTS  .*


         PS Messages that are entered locally (i.e.  local bit is set) 
         are always sent.  A message for a node that is not  mentioned 
         in  the route file is sent directly.  This applies to  normal 
         mail and crashmail.



         Section 3:

         What there is else to know.


         Paths:

         Bermuda   uses   a   environment  variable   to   find   it's 
         configuration files and so do some other utils.
         You  should  use MAILER and let that point to  the  directory 
         bermuda,  pack/import/scan and the configuration  files,  are 
         in.  You  can  set  your environment variable if  you  use  a 
         commandline   interpreter  like  Pcommand.   Put   into   the 
         autoexec.bat:  SET MAILER=C:\TB\


         Batch files:

         To run a mailer system, point BBS etc. you must either use  a 
         commandline  interpreter  or a special shell.  If you  use  a 
         commandline  interpreter you will need to make  batch  files. 
         Your mailer will give certain errorlevels (return codes) when 
         it exists.  The errorlevel depends on the action to be taken. 
         An errorlevel of 20 could mean 'mail recieved' so you need to 
         startup your import program. An example:

         :start
         TB Unattanded

         If ERRORLEVEL 20 goto IMPORT
         If ERRORLEVEL 21 goto SCAN

         :import
         import -t -p -a c:\tb\whatarc.ttp x
         scan -t -a c:\tb\whatarc.ttp a
         goto start

         :scan
         scan -t -p
         pack -t -s call
         goto start


         Just to give you an idea. Try it out.



         Arcmail:

         Default  import and pack use ARC.TTP But arcmail is  not  the 
         most used anymore as better compression techniques  are  used 
         (LZH/ZIP).  To be able to use that we need a special program, 
         in this case called whatarc.
         In  stead of calling arc you put -A c:\tb\whatarc.ttp on  the 
         commandline EVERY time pack and import is  run.  Whatarc  wil 
         make it possible to send and recieve ARC/LZH/ZIP/ARJ mail.
         Whatarc  has  it's own documentation and is not part  of  the 
         Bermuda package.


         Exporting mail for other systems.

         Systems  that send mail to other systems or/and  have  points 
         should put -P on the commandline of import and scan. In stead 
         of routing all mail via the netmail area all mail is directly 
         put into packets which pack only needs to archive. This makes 
         processing mail for other systems MUCH faster and it takes  a 
         lot less diskspace.



         Using Bermuda with Binkley ST

         Bermuda  was  designed  to be used with The  Box  as  Fidonet 
         mailer,  but  you can use Bermuda with Binkley  ST  too.  The 
         major problem is that the outbound folder of Binkley ST has a 
         different format the The Box. To make it possible for Bermuda 
         to  work  with Binkley ST you need to  convert  the  outbound 
         folder. To do this there is Packconv, a package that consists 
         of  2 programs called BINK2TB and TB2BINK.  BINK2TB  converts 
         the  outbound from Binkley ST in The Box format  and  TB2BINK 
         does the opposite.  You need to run BINK2TB every time before 
         you  start  up any of the Bermuda programs  and  run  TB2BINK 
         before  you start up Binkley ST.  Makes you wonder why  there 
         isn't a standard format...  Packconv also is not part of  the 
         Bermuda package.  But both whatarc and packconv can be  found 
         at most Atari ST based Fidonet systems.



         Oke I have talked enough,  set it up and have fun.  And don't 
         forget:  always read the documentation,  and ask other people 
         if you have questions. That's exactly what Fidonet is for.

         As  a final word we would like to thank all  the  betatesters 
         and people with idea's for their help.

         Greetings       Theo Runia & Jac Kersing
