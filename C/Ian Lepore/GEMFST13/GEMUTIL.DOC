* GEMUTIL.DOC - Descriptions of the utility functions in GEMFAST.
*
*  08/28/89 - v1.3
*             Massive changes have been made to the utilty routines, and
*             to this document.  Your best bet is to read the entire doc
*             over again.
*
*             Most of the changes involve renaming routines to move toward
*             a consistant naming standard (which is to pave the way for
*             things planned for v2.0).  I've done my best to cover the
*             name changes with #define statements in GEMFAST.H, so your
*             existing code should work, but you should make every effort
*             to convert existing and new code to the new names.  Sorry,
*             I guess I wasn't thinking far enough ahead when I did the
*             first release.
*             
*             For all the renamed routines, I've put the old name in
*             the title bar of the new function's name.

This document describes the functions in the AESUTxxx modules of the
GEMFAST bindings.  These are not GEM function calls, and thus are not
documented in standard GEM programming guides.

Within this document, the most recent set of changes will be indicated by
a vertical bar (|) in column 1.

Definitions:

GRECT     - A graphics-type rectangle of the form x,y,w,h.  A GRECT
            describes a screen area by defining the x/y of the upper left
            corner, and the width and height of the area.

VRECT     - A vdi-type rectangle of the form x1,y1,x2,y2.  A VRECT
            describes a screen area by defining the upper left and lower
            right corners of the area in x/y coordinates.

xRECT     - Used to indicate that either of the above types is accepted.

;*************************************************************************

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rc_copy
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void rc_copy (xRECT *source, xRECT *dest)

        This function copies a rectangle.  It will copy either a GRECT or
        VRECT type rectangle.  More generally, it will copy 2 longwords
        from source to dest, they don't have to be rectangles at all.
         >> NOTE BACKWARDS ORDER OF SOURCE & DEST.  Sorry, not my decision.
     
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rc_equal
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

bool rc_equal(xRECT *rect1, xRECT *rect2)
        
        This function tests 2 rectangles for equality and returns TRUE/FALSE
        (1/0) accordingly.  Works on GRECT or VRECT type rectangles, but
        both rectangles must be of the same type.  More generally, this
        function compare 2 sets of 2 contiguous longwords.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rc_intersect
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
bool rc_intersect(GRECT *rect1, GRECT *rect2)

        This function computes the intersection of 2 rectangles.  It works
        only for GRECT type rectangles.  The intersection is the parts of 
        two rectangles which overlap each other; this function is typically
        used in processing the AES window-update rectangle list.  The result
        is placed into 'rect2', overlaying the original data (again, not my
        decision).  TRUE/FALSE is returned, depending on whether the 
        rectangles had a common intersected area or not; the values in 
        'rect2' are modified regardless of whether there was an intersection or not.
        If the rectangle representing the intersecting area has a width or
        height of zero, this routine will return TRUE.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rc_union
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void rc_union(GRECT *rect1, GRECT *rect2)

        This function computes the union of two rectangles.  The union is 
        the single rectangle that encompases all the area defined by the 
        individual rectangles.  It works only for GRECT type rectangles.  
        The result is placed into 'rect2'.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rc_vtog
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
void rc_vtog(VRECT *rect1, GRECT *rect2)

        This function converts a VRECT rectangle to a GRECT rectangle.
        Do not specify the same rectangle for input and output.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rc_gtov
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
void rc_gtov(GRECT *rect1, VRECT *rect2)

        This function converts a GRECT rectangle to a VRECT rectangle.
        Do not specify the same rectangle for input and output.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rc_vadjust            (formerly objclv_adjust)
; rc_gadjust            (formerly objclg_adjust)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
void rc_vadjust(VRECT *rect, int h_adjust, int v_adjust);
void rc_gadjust(GRECT *rect, int h_adjust, int v_adjust);

        These functions expand or contract a rectangle by a given amount
        in each axis. A positive value exands the area, a negative
        value contracts it.  You must use rc_gadjust for GRECTs and
        rc_vadjust for VRECTs.  
        
|       Negative results are prevented by the adjust routines; zero will be 
|       placed into any rectangle structure element which would have been 
|       negative after the adjustment.
        
;*************************************************************************
; Object utilities.
;*************************************************************************

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; obj_xywh              (formerly objc_xywh)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void obj_xywh( OBJECT *tree, int object, GRECT *rect);

        Returns an object's x/y/w/h values into a GRECT rectangle.  Note
        that the x/y values are NOT automatically adjusted to screen 
        coordinates, they are copied directly from the object tree 
        structure.  (Thus if the object index is 0 (R_TREE) the rectangle 
        will reflect screen coordinates, for any child object it will not.)

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; obj_offxywh
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void obj_offxywh( OBJECT *tree, int object, GRECT *rect);

        Returns any object's screen-adjusted x/y/w/h values into a GRECT 
        rectangle.  This is a shortcut to calling objc_offset() then
        copying the object's w/h data into the GRECT structure.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; obj_stchange          (formerly objst_change)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void obj_stchange(OBJECT *tree, int object, int statemask, int updateflag);

        This function sets or resets bits in an object's ob_state field.
        Depending on the setting of 'updateflag' the object is updated 
        on the screen or not. (Update is done via objc_draw internally).
        If the high bit of 'statemask' is set, the state bits are reset,
        otherwise they are set.  This allows the following syntax:
           objst_change(mytree, myobj,  SELECTED, TRUE);
           objst_change(mytree, myobj, ~SELECTED, FALSE);
        The first case will set 'myobj' to SELECTED and show it that way
        on the screen.  The second case will set 'myobj' to non-selected,
        and will not update the screen.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; obj_flchange          (formerly objfl_change)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void obj_flchange(OBJECT *tree, int object, int flagsmask, int updateflag);

        This function sets or resets bits in an object's ob_flags field.
        Depending on the setting of 'updateflag' the object is updated 
        on the screen or not. (Update is done via objc_draw internally).
        If the high bit of 'flagsmask' is set, the flags bits are reset,
        otherwise they are set.  This allows the following syntax:
           objfl_change(mytree, myobj,  HIDETREE, TRUE);
           objfl_change(mytree, myobj, ~HIDETREE, FALSE);
        The first case will set 'myobj' to hidden and will erase it from
        the screen.  The second case will set 'myobj' to visible, but does
        not update the screen.
        Note that you CAN use this function to hide and unhide trees
        visibly on the screen.  When the objc_draw is called internally
        by this function, the draw starts at the root of the tree, but is
        clipped by the x/y/w/h of the object who's state is being changed.
        This means that a flag change to HIDETREE with update will draw
        the parents of the hidden object, effectively erasing it on the
        screen.  The same holds true for setting an object to ~HIDETREE;
        the object will be redrawn and become visible.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; obj_rbfind            (formerly objxrb_which)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

int  obj_rbfind(OBJECT *tree, int parentobj, int state);

        This function returns the index of the first child object of the
        specified parent which is in the desired state, or -1 if no child
        objects are in that state.  Note that the state test is done via
        bit-wise AND. As an example, it is possible to find an object which is
        either SELECTED *OR* CROSSED, but it is not possible to limit the
        search to objects which are *both* SELECTED *AND* CROSSED.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; objrb_which           (old name, which will be dropped eventualy)
; obj_rbwhich           (old name, which will be dropped eventualy)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

int  objrb_which(OBJECT *tree, int parentobj);

        This function returns the index of the first child object of the
        specified parent which has the SELECTED bit set, or -1 if no child
        objects are selected.  It is most useful in determining which 
|       radio button in a group has been selected.  This function is
|       supported via a #define in the GEMFAST.H file, and actually 
|       generates a call to obj_rbfind(), passing a state of SELECTED.

|       This function is being phased out, it is recommended that you use
|       obj_rbfind(tree, parent, SELECTED) to perform this function.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; obj_parent
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

int  obj_parent(OBJECT *tree, int curentobj);

        This function returns the index of the parent object of the
        specified object.  By definition, the root object in a tree has
        no parent, 0 will be returned (as if the root were its own parent).
        This function is useful for things like building your own radio
        button handler using evnt_multi().

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; objcl_calc            (THIS ROUTINE IS BEING PHASED OUT!)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void objcl_calc(OBJECT *tree, int object, {GRECT *r1|NULL}, {VRECT *r2|NULL});

|       THIS ROUTINE IS BEING PHASED OUT, DO NOT RELY ON IT!  It will be
|       rewritten someday, but will have a new name (obj_clipcalc).

        This routine does clipping calculations for an object. It calculates
        both GRECT and VRECT clipping rectangle simulataneously; if you
        specify a null pointer for one of the rectangle types those values
        won't be returned.  This function will handle OUTLINED and SHADOWED
        objects, and will return the proper clipping rectangle to be passed
        to objc_draw() or vs_clip().  Typical usage might be:
         To redraw an object after changing ob_state or ob_flags...
            objcl_calc(mytree, refreshobj, &cliprect, 0L);
            objc_draw(mytree, refreshobj, MAX_DEPTH, cliprect);
         To outline an object with a VDI rounded rectangle...  
            objcl_calc(mytree, refreshobj, 0L, &boxrect);
            v_rbox(vdi_handle, &boxrect);

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rsc_sstrings
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void rsc_sstrings(OBJECT *tree, 
                    int obj1,char *ptr1,
                    [obj2,ptr2, ... objn,ptrn,]
                    -1);
                 
        This function sets one or more string pointers within an object
        tree.  It understands the difference between STRING, BUTTON, and
        TEXT object types, and sets the appropriate pointer fields (ob_spec
        or te_ptext).  Any number of object/pointer pairs may be specified,
        the list is terminated by a negative object number.  The purpose
        of this function is to replace all the lines of code looking like...
            *((TEDINFO *)(tree[object].ob_spec))->te_ptext = pointer;
        with the simpler construct...
            rsc_strings(tree, str1obj,pstr1, 
                              txt1obj,ptxt1, 
                              /* etc */ 
                              -1);

|       This routine understands objects with the INDIRECT flag set, and 
|       will use the ob_spec field as an indirect pointer if appropriate.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rsc_gstrings
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void rsc_gstrings(OBJECT *tree, 
                    int obj1,char **ptr1,
                    [obj2,**ptr2, ... objn,**ptrn,]
                    -1);
                 
        This function gets one or more string pointers from within an object
        tree.  It understands the difference between TEXT/nonTEXT object
        types, and gets the appropriate fields (ob_spec or te_ptext). 
        Any number of object/pointer pairs may be specified, the list is
        terminated by a negative object number.  This is a provided as a 
        shortcut to doing a long series of rsrc_gaddr() calls to get the
        string/text pointers from a tree.  Note that this function is not
        as flexible as rsrc_gaddr()...if the object type is one of the
        text objects, it will return a te_ptext pointer, otherwise the
        ob_spec value is returned.  When used with strings/text, the 
        ob_spec field will be a string pointer.

          example() {
          char *string1;
          char *text2;
                    
          rsrc_gaddr(R_TREE, MYTREE, &mytree);
          rsc_gstrings(mytree, MYSTR1,&string1,
                               MYTXT2,&text2,
                               -1);
          }
 
|       This routine understands objects with the INDIRECT flag set, and 
|       will use the ob_spec field as an indirect pointer if appropriate.
|
|       Unlike previous releases, this routine has now been tested.
        
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; rsc_treefix
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
          
void rsc_treefix(OBJECT *tree);
        
        This function performs an rsrc_obfix() call for all objects in
        a tree.  It's handy when using resource trees imbedded as source
        code within your program, which require manual x/y fixup.  
        NOTE:  This functions uses the LASTOB bit in ob_flags to determine
        when it has hit the end of the tree.  When coding your resource
        tree, please be careful to set the LASTOB bit in the last object 
        in the array.  Note that this is NOT a routine to provide a full
        fixup of .RSH-type code emmitted by a resource construction editor;
        this routine does only x/y/w/h fixup on a single tree, and does 
        not resolve cross-structure pointers.

; Graphics Utilities.
;  These utilties are NOT available in C source code form, as they use
;  the Line-A TOS interface, which must be accessed via assembler code.
;*************************************************************************

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; gra_qonmouse          (formerly graqon_mouse)
; gra_qofmouse          (formerly graqof_mouse)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

void graqon_mouse();
void graqof_mouse();

        These routines turn the mouse pointer on and off quickly (using
        the Line-A HideMouse/ShowMouse routines).  They will execute much
        faster than the equivelant graf_mouse() calls, and they behave
|       in a similar manner.  Specifically, the graf_mouse() calls track 
|       the number of Hide/Show calls and if you 'hide' the mouse 3 times, 
|       you must use the 'show' call 3 times before the mouse reappears.  
|       These routines will behave in the same way (as of v1.3).  

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
; gra_qmstate           (formerly graq_mstate)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

graq_mstate(int *mousex, int *mousey, int *mousebtns);

        This routine returns the mouse x/y location and button state
        quickly, using the Line-A variable structure as the source of 
        information.  It is much faster than the graf_mkstate() call, and
        it does not return the keyboard state information.  If you have
        an application full of graf_mkstate() calls that don't use the
        keystate info, you can code 
          #define graf_mkstate(a,b,c,d) graq_mstate((a),(b),(c))
        at the top of your program and instantly convert to the faster
        routine.  (Caveat:  This routine is NOT well-tested in v1.0).
        
|       (NOTE:  I've had problems with using this routine in conjunction
|       with evnt_mouse and evnt_multi type calls.  It seems that if you
|       use the AES graf_mkstate() call it will (maybe?) clear some flag
|       indicating a mouse-related event is pending.  When you use this
|       Line-A routine, the event is left pending, and the next evnt_????
|       call doesn't work as you'd expect.  I know, I know, I'm not being
|       very clear; that's only because I haven't looked into it too 
|       closely.  All I can say for sure is that some well-tested code
|       broke when I #defined graf_mkstate to invoke this routine, and when
|       I put it back, the code started working again.  Other code, however
|       works just fine with graf_mkstate #define'd to this routine.- Ian)
