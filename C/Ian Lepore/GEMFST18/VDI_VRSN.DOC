
 Version notes for VDIFAST...
 
 v1.8   02/21/91    Miscellanious fixes and additions.
 
   - escape funcs   All escape functions in VDIESCP1.S (those that take
                    only a VDI handle as a parm) were broken, now fixed.
                    A couple functions in VDIESCP2.S also fixed.
                    
   - v_curtext      This function's label was not defined as global, so 
                    the linker would report this as an unknown function.
                    
   - vqt_fontinfo   This was incorrectly named v_qt_fontinfo() in prior
                    versions.
                    
   - vqt_width      This was incorrectly named (missing its leading 
                    underbar character) in prior versions.
                    
   - (all funcs)    Split the source code into a bajillion modules, most
                    with only one function per module.  This makes the
                    library a bit bigger, and should make your programs a
                    bit smaller, since fewer unused functions will get 
                    linked in just because they live in the same module
                    as something you do use.
