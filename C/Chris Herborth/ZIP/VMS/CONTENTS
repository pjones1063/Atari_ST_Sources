MAKE/VMS is no longer supported since MMK (MMS clone by Matt Madison/MadGoat
Enterprises, compatible with descrip.mms) is both free and becoming quite 
popular.  MMK is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.spc.edu/ftp.wku.edu and 
by mailserver at wkuvx1.wku.edu.  Check VMS newsgroups for announcements and 
exact location.

The MAKE.COM command file is only set up to compile the default version.  To
compile with VMSCLI (or other options) defined, edit DESCRIP.MMS appropriately
and compile with that.
