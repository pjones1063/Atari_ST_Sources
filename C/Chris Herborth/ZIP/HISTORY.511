UnZip, version 5.11, 2 August 1994

New features, you betcha:

 - added SFX stuff to makefile.os2 and os2.c [CN, Kai Uwe]
 - revised CONTRIBS file [CN]
 - NT:  added minor SFX ifdefs; updated makefile for unzipsfx compilation;
    added NT section to INSTALL file [Henry, CN]
 - Unix:  renamed aix target to aix_rt (for IBM PC/RT); added new aix target
    as synonym for rs6000, as in zip [Jean-loup, Antoine, Daniel Lewart, CN]
 - NT:  makefile tweak for DEC C/C++ [Jack Stansbury]
 - speeded up printing of zipfile comments (replaced putchar with buffering;
    replaced NUKE_CRs) [CN, Kai Uwe, Kris Kwilas]
 - MS-DOS:  moved all strings (except few small ones) to far memory so unzip
    can be compiled in small memory model, *with* zipinfo support! [Johnny Lee]
 - Unix, MS-DOS, VMS:  added Christian Spieler performance tweaks
 - removed HSIZE2 stuff since not used anywhere [CN]
 - wrote new unshrink() (flat-memory machines only for now) [CN]
 - distributed far strings back into original files and tweaked SFX code some
    more; now *all* executables smaller (2KB or more), for some reason... [CN]
 - MS-DOS:  added unzipsfx and updated DOS targets in Unix Makefile and in
    OS/2 makefile and in MS-DOS makefiles to use small model [CN]
 - Unix:  added unzipsfx to UNZIPS [CN]
5.11b:
 - added UNZIPOPT as alternate name for environment variable; not checked
    unless UNZIP (or UNZIP_OPTS) empty [CN, Mike, Jean-loup]
 - VMS:  added VMSWILD option to use % instead of ? (single-char wildcard)
    and disallow ranges ([..]) [CN, Mike]

    and generated table (700-1000 bytes savings) [Mark, CN]

    checkdir(ROOT) routines (os2.c, msdos.c) [CN]
 - added a few file_id.diz files for PCBoard users (some DOS-based BBS) [CN]
 - Unix:  check for foo.ZIP as well as foo.zip [CN, Jeff Garzik]
 - added OS and compiler version info as extension of -v option (Unix, OS/2
    and MS-DOS only, so far...) [CN]

 - added prototype version() routines for Amiga, Atari, Human68k, Macintosh,
    TOPS-20 and VMS [CN]
 - partially disabled check for multi-part archives so that concatenation of
    pieces might(?) work (probably only for two-part archives, which already
    worked in 5.11b; some files in bigger archives may now extract OK) [CN]
 - updated usage screen to reflect -C and new -v functionality; removed -c and
    old -v entry [CN]
 - added clone zfstrcpy() (copy strings using far pointers) for older compilers
    so all SMALL_MEM machines can now use small memory model [CN]

==================

These changes occurred in beta versions 5.11a to 5.11j.  This list may have 
left out some bugfixes and even some features...the brain cell is going, 
folks (as Mark would say).  Apologies, etc.
