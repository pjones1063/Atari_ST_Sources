Command Line Options
====================

The InfoTaskForce Infocom Interpreter has the following command line syntax:

	infocom [-aehlnoprstvx] <data_file_name>


where the options have the following meaning:

-a	Monitors the interpreters setting, clearing and testing of all 
	object attributes during the game. This can be useful if, 
	for example, there is a door that you cannot open - you 
	watch which attribute bit is being tested by the interpreter 
	when you try to open the door, and then exit the game and 
	set the bit manually in the game's data file (or hack the 
	interpreter sources to do it for you !). This option only 
	works when the interpreter has been compiled with the 
	CHEAT macro defined.

-e	Normally, any user input is not echoed to stdout - input
	echoing is done locally by your PC or terminal. However, if 
	you are redirecting stdout to a file, you should set this 
	option so that any input characters are also echoed to your 
	output file.

-h	Display the data file's Header information on stdout. The 
	game is not executed.

-l	Force the interpreter to pre_load the entire game data file 
	into memory instead of swapping in only those pages 
	currently being executed (it normally uses a Least 
	Recently Used swapping strategy).

-n	Force the interpreter to use "enhanced" routines when 
	playing a STANDARD series game.

-o	Display the data file's Object/Room List on stdout. The 
	game is not executed.

-p	Disable the formatting of stdout into screen pages separated 
	by [MORE].

-r	Display the data file's Object/Room List on stdout in tree 
	format. Not all the list's information is shown in this format 
	- use the -o option for a more complete listing. The game is 
	not executed.

-s	Display the data file's Property List for every object on 
	stdout. The game is not executed.

-t	Monitor the transfer of objects between locations during the 
	game. This is useful to monitor the actions of any 
	background actors in the game (e.g.: Zork 1's thief). 
	Please note that using this option can spoil some games 
	(specifically Deadline and Witness). This option only works 
	when the interpreter has been compiled with the CHEAT 
	macro defined.

-v	Display the data file's Vocabulary List on stdout. The game 
	is not executed.

-x	Display the data file's Vocabulary List on stdout, including 
	the attribute bytes used internally by the game's parser. 
	The game is not executed.


Legal Stuff
===========

We have developed the InfoTaskForce interpreter for use with legally purchased
Infocom datafiles. We do not supply any datafiles - they must be purchased
and the Software Licence agreement for their use must be observed. Most
datafiles are available in the Lost Treasures of Infocom collections and are
quite inexpensive.

This program is provided "as is", without any warranty of any kind. The entire
risk as to its quality and performance is with you.  In no event will
InfoTaskForce be liable for damages arising from the use of this program.

If you distribute this program, please distribute the entire package.
