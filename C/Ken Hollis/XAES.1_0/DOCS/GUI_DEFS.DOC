GUI_DEFS.SYS            GUI Definitions System File            Documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GUI_DEFS is the system file for  XAES which controls how it looks and feels.
The GUI_DEFS  file is  completely  configurable  by either  the user  or the
programmer  as  he/she feels  fit.   The  GUI_DEFS file  that  was  included
originally with XAES is considered the default setup for XAES.   You can use
any standard  text editor  to adjust  the information,  or use the  CPX file
that is included.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is intended to explain each option that can be set in the GUI_DEFS
system file, and to decribe what the settings are for each option.

WinX Compatibility Setting
LEFT_BORDER_MOVE

    The LEFT_BORDER_MOVE setting lets you move windows off of the left side
of the screen.  This setting is only permitted if you have WinX installed.
The reason being that GEM doesn't know how to handle the redraw of windows
if drawn off the left side of the screen; AES can't handle negative graphic
coordinates very well.

	The valid settings for the LEFT_BORDER_MOVE are boolean values: TRUE and
FALSE.
