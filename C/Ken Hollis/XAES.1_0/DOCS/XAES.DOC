 The Extended Application Environment System

 Version 1.00, Release 1
 For Pure C and Laser C programmers only!

 This program is Freeware (partly because there is no more market for the
 Atari ST) and may be freely modified and redistributed, revamped, and
 ported, provided you give its author, Ken Hollis, credit.

 Programming credits:

 XAES has gone through quite a number of reprogrammings and redesignings to
 make it what it is today.  This could not be done without the help from
 various individuals that have helped me over the past course of the year.
 I felt it was my part to name some of these people so they could be
 recognized for their generous contributions.

 Thanks goes out to:

 Christian Grunenberg, Warwick Allison, Markus Gutschke (for lending me
 the source code to WindClass), Eric R. Smith, Andrew O. Smith (for the
 criticism), Dan Wilga, Olaf Meisiek, Karl Anders 0ygard (for all the help
 we gave each other with the first WinLIB PRO project), Sascha Blank (sorry
 I didn't use your GNU Extensions, buddy!), Steve Sowerby (for his library),
 Thomas Binder (for the wonderful treecopy routine he contributed), Oliver
 Scheel (for the helpful ideas from the Let 'em Fly source)

 Contacting the author:

 There are one of many ways to contact the author of XAES.  One is to use
 Snail-Mail by writing to the following address:

 Ken Hollis
 PO Box 1588
 Grants Pass, OR 97526

 Another way is to write E-Mail to root@bitgate.chatlink.com.

 Yet another way is to use web pages at "http://www.bitgate.chatlink.com"
 and writing feedback.

 Yes, I know I did help write LTMF, but that project has been long since
 suspended.  I may continue work on it, but for now, the source code has be-
 come public domain material.  You can retrieve it from your local FTP site.
 And quit complaining about LTMF.  :-)
