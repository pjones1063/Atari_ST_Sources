I use this program to convert .GEM files created by UniTerm (with GDOS
loaded) into .GEM files that EasyDraw can read.  The differences between
the two formats include:

1. EasyDraw has page size and option information in the header and
   preface of the .GEM file.
2. UniTerm uses a different scale than EasyDraw.
3. EasyDraw uses additional instructions to identify groups.
4. UniTerm seems to break polylines into simple vectors (plines with n=2)
   which cannot be handled in a useful way in EasyDraw.

The EZGEM.TOS program corrects these differences by (1) writing a fixed
header/preface borrowed from an EasyDraw file and tossing the UniTerm
header/preface; (2) rescaling all points to fall on the EasyDraw page;
(3) turning each polyline into an EasyDraw object; (4) collecting
connected vectors into true polylines whenever possible.

I have converted very complex drawings such as maps and 3-D plots using
this program and have found it quite useful for enhancing graphics from
less intelligent plotting packages.  There are some things to keep in
mind though:

- Output file size varies greatly relative to the input file size;
  plots with lots of short lines may double in size, while plots
  with long polylines may be reduced to half the original size.
- EasyDraw's limit of 10000 objects is rather hard to exceed, but keep
  it in mind.
- This program only processes polyline operations in the input file.
  That's all I see in my monochrome .GEM files.  It is possible that
  some applications may generate color or line style instructions; if
  so, have fun modifying the program to handle them!
- Avoid dashed lines in the plots you capture.  If possible, use solid
  lines exclusively, and change them to dashed lines within EasyDraw.

Feel free to distribute this ARC collection to anyone anywhere by
any means.  PLEASE keep the files together so the recipients can
customize the programs as desired.
