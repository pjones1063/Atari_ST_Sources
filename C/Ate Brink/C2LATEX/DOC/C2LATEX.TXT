DESCRIPTION
     c++2latex is a tool for generating LaTeX source from ANSI-C or C++
     programs.  It recogizes all keywords, strings, and comments. These
     recognized parts can be set in different fonts. c++2latex can
     generate complete LaTeX files which can directly passed through
     latex(1) or parts of LaTeX files which can be included in other files
      (either direct or by the \input or \include commands).
     
     The output filename is searched in various steps. First, if the
     {-o,+output} flag is given, the output is written to the file pointed
     to by the value of this flag. If the {-t,+pipe} option is given, the
     output is written to stdout. (It is an error to specify both options
     together.) If none of this options but an input pathname is given, the
     output is written to a file who's name is the last component of the
     input pathname with the substituted or else added suffix '.tex'.
     If the input is read from stdin and none of the above options is given,
     the output is written to '<program-name>.tex' with <program-name> being
     the name of this program.

OPTIONS
     c++2latex has the following options:

     {-a,+ansi-c}
             The input is an ANSI-C program. Default is C++, so don't give
             this option for C++ programs and always give this option for
             ANSI-C programs.

     {-c,+complete-file}
             The output is enveloped in commands which produce a complete
             LaTeX source.

     {-h,+header}
             Each page of output has a header giving the input file name and
             the date the file was produced. This option implies the
             {-c,+complete-file} option.

     {-i,+indentation} length
             Gives the amount of indentation for each leading blank (tabs are
             converted to blanks). Default is `0.5em'.

     {-o,+output} path
             The output is written in the file pointed to by path.

     {-s,+font-size} size
             The LaTeX source is set in size pt. Default is `11'.

     {-t,+pipe}
             The output is written to stdout.

     {-C,+comment-font} font
             The comments are set in the given font. Default is `it'.

     {-H,+header-font} font
             The headers are set in the given font. Default is `sl'.

     {-K,+keyword-font} font
             The keywords are set in the given font. Default is `bf'.

     {-P,+cpp-font} font
             The preprocessor directives are set in the given font.
             Default is `tt'.

     {-S,+string-font} font
             The string and character constants are set in the given font.
             Default is `tt'.

     {-T,+tabstop} wide
             The wide of tabs is wide. Default is `8'.

     {-V,+version}
             Prints the version number on stderr.

OPTION SUMMARY
     To give no oprion at all is the same as to give the options
           -i 0.5em -s 11 -C it -H sl -K bf -P tt -S tt -T 8

DIAGNOSTICS
      Can't use {-t,+pipe} and {-o,+output} together.
              At most one of this options may be given.

      Can't open `<path>' for reading
              The program failed to open <path> for reading.

      Can't open `%s' for writing
              The program failed to open <path> for writing. All output
              is written in the current directory if not explicitly
              changed by {-o,+output}.

      Virtual memory exhausted
              The program failed to allocate storage. As this is only done
              for the construction of pathnames, this error will normally
              indicate a program error.

DEFICIENCIES / BUGS
      The program should be completly rewitten to understand language
      descriptions ala tgrind.
