- The controller has an "over-current protection" mode that disable the USB
  ports when over-current condition exists. With the NetUSBee one of the ports 
  gets disable as soon as the power is on, it’s necessary to disable this 
  protection mode or to force ports to be always powered (see bit 
  NoPowerSwitching in HcRhDescriptorA register).
  Something looks wrong at the hardware level?.

- There are small design differences between NetUSBees depending on the
  manufacturer. The NetUSBees made from the original design have a
  problem that causes one of the ports to be disabled as soon as the
  host controller becomes operational. With those cards the driver
  must turn off the overcurrent protection mode for the card
  to work properly.
  We allow the user to turn on the overcurrent protection by creating
  a file in the driver's directory (MiNT) or the root directory (TOS)
  named "netusbee.ocp"
