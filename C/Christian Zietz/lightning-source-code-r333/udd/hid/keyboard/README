USB Keyboard Driver for TOS & MiNT
Developed by Christian Zietz - Licensed under GPL

This driver is to be considered a beta version. Yet it has been successfully 
tested with the Lightning VME USB card for Atari MegaSTE and Atari TT and with 
a lot of different keyboards.

This driver directly maps keys from the USB keyboard to the Atari keyboard.
This means that if you for example connect a keyboard to a German Atari, you'll 
get a German layout, regardless of the layout of the USB keyboard. In particular, 
for Atari layouts that require you pressing Alt+key to type certain characters 
(e.g. on the German layout Alt+Ü gives "@"), you have to use the same key combination 
on the USB keyboard, not the combination that you're used to from your PC or Mac.

Mapping of keys that do not exist on a PC keyboard:
F11 -> Help
F12 -> Undo
Page up -> Shift arrow up
Page down -> Shift arrow down
Home -> Clr Home
End -> Shift Clr Home
PrintScr -> Alt Help
Scroll Lock -> Keypad (
Pause -> Keypad )

Caps lock is implemented and the LED works. If the caps lock state is changed by
the Atari keyboard, the LED will turn on or off accordingly.

Keys without an equivalent on the Atari are without function.

TOS 2 or higher is required, otherwise an error message will be displayed and the driver 
won't load.
