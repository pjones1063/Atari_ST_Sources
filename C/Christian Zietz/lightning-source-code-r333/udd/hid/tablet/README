Graphics Tablet Driver for TOS, MagiC & MiNT

Developed by Claude Labelle -Licensed under GPL

Supports the Wacom Intuos S (model CTL-4100) and the PF1209 tablets.
May work on  Wacom Intuos M (model CTL-6100WL). Does not work with Wacom
Bamboo CTH-470, CTH-670, Intuos M CTH-680. May work with other USB graphics
tablets.

The tablet replaces the mouse for precise drawing using a lightweight
cordless stylus using no battery. A mouse can still co-exist.

Moving the stylus over the tablet (without touching it) moves the mouse
pointer.

The stylus buttons are programmed as follow:

- Tip (when in contact with tablet) = left mouse button

- Lower barrel button = right mouse button

- Upper barrel button = UNDO key.

The tablet function keys are programmed as follow (Wacom Intuos only):

- 1 = Esc key.

- 2 = Unassigned

- 3 = Tip pressure detection on/off. Sends CTRL-1 to CTRL-9 according to
pressure. The graphics program VISION supports these keyboard shortcuts to
vary the line thickness.

- 4 = Recalibration. To match the screen resolution to the tablet's. Use
after a resolution change or as needed.

Note that the function keys don't work when the stylus is near or on the
tablet surface.

Known problem: If you leave the stylus on the tablet when booting, the driver
may crash. Solution: Leave the stylus on the function keys, in its sleave or
away from the tablet while booting.
