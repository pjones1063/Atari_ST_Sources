C3P.TTP (or CYB_POV.TTP) is a tool to convert 3D2 files (Cybersculpt) to
POV format. In this version, it can generates "smooth_triangles", too.

The folders contains the source (only documented in german, sorry), a german
docfile, a german man and (YES) an ugly translated english man-file (you can
take a look at all options there).
If anybody wants to translate the docfile to english, it's welcome !!!
