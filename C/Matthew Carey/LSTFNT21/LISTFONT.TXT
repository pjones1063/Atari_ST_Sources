Listfont.prg

This is a quick hack using the various font file formats to compile a
list of font names and file names within a selected path.

I look at the files directly so no form of GDOS is needed to run this
program.

Supported font formats

TrueType - thanks to Christer (wingel@ctrl-c.liu.se)
Calamus
Postscript Type 1 and Type 3
GDOS GEM Bitmap
Bitstream Speedo (Both encrypted and unencrypted)
Ghostscript GSF
PageStream
Compugraphic

Now in a slightly modeless version and now can output listing in a comma
delimited format for easy inclusion in database/spreadsheet programs.

The delimited format is:
"A:\PATH\NAME\","TYP","FILENAME.TYP","Font Name from the Font"\n

\n stands for newline.

Possible Problems

Some newer GDOS fonts have different tails depending on the output device.

Also if you do not have the 40 folder fix installed using this program
will cause trouble.

This program is freeware, that is I retain the copyright but I grant 
anybody a free license to use and copy this software but not to sell 
it for commercial gain.

I can take no responsibility for the consequences of this programs use.
