Hello and welcome to VISION's series
I'm Jean and I would like to introduce you to this software
I started created well, more than 25 years ago
Before jumping into this subject, let me just say that VISION is an image manager application running on any ATARI TOS machine
For my demo, I will usually show it on Aranym which is a virtual machine running on Windows/Linux or Mac.
I'll try to vary a bit across all possible ATARI TOS virtual machines available but expect Aranym to be the more used, simply because it's  the fastest ATARI TOS experience available for a regular PC.
So let' jump into these series, this is the 1st episode and I will basically show you how to install/configure VISION and use it very basically.
