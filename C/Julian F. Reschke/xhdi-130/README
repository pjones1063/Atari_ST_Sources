Dear software developer!

This is the lastest edition of the XHDI specification (see the other files 
for details). This version is the result of a long discussion between driver 
and application developers (virtual memory, copying tools, disk tools, 
filesystem drivers).

This archive may be distributed freely, as long as all original files are 
included (and only those). Please delete the older versions XHDI-100.ZOO, 
XHDI-101.ZOO, XHDI-110.ZOO, XHDI-120.ZOO and XHDI-125.ZOO wherever you find 
them.

Included files are:

intro.{txt|eng}       - Rationale
xhdispec.{txt|eng}    - The specification
xhdi.c, xhdi.h        - Bindings for Pure C
df.ttp, df.man        - A sample XHDI aware application

WARNING
-------
NO WARRANTY: I guarantee for nothing, especially not for the correctness 
of DF.TTP, XHDI.C and XHDI.H. Use at your own risk!

See `intro.*' for further details.
