READ THIS README CAREFULLY OR YOU'LL
DAMAGE YOUR MONITOR!

Overscan NewRez 1.6n

This is a pre-alpha-version of a 
patched overscan 1.6 driver that
enables your ST (only ST, NOT STe)
to display one of the 3 new display
modes czietz discovered, see
atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=34108
This driver enables this mode on
your desktop when put in AUTO folder
and the ST is booted in color mode.
Other PRGs changing the systems re-
solution might break everything.

The desktop resolution is 320x400x4
at 72 Hz.

Only use this if you really read and
understood the following:
-your normal RGB monitor (e.g. via
 SCART cable is not capable of 
 showing this mode, it WILL be 
 damaged
-this literally sends 72Hz video to
 a 50Hz device if not carefull,
 thus (you guessed it) damaging it
-you NEED a multisync or TFT
 monitor for this
-you NEED an RGB capable vga switch/
 adapter like the following:

-this only works on ST, NOT STe
-this only works with TOS 1.02/1.04
-just use plain TOS
-disable all other AUTO Prg, esp.
 QuickST, Warp9 etc.
-the driver part for monochrome mode
 does not work & bombs, hence the 
 pre-alpha
-this is NOT for production use

This IS NOT TESTED, so proceed on
your own risk.

If someone has compilable sources
of OVERSCAN >=2.x or Lacescan >=3,
please contact me @atari-forum.com

There might not be an alpha or even
a beta, so don't hold your breath.

Have fun,
