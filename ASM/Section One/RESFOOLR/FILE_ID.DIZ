Fool your Falcon that you have a TV/SC
Rez Fooler is a program that (hopefully) will fool your Falcon and make it
think you've got another kind of monitor connected than the one actually
connected. This is mostly because some demos won't run on a standard TV, 
although it should (from the programmers point of view, there is no
difference between a standard TV and a RGB monitor).
