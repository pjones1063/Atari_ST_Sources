This alpha version of mp2 replays (in realtime) almost every
standard MPEG2 Layer2 44.1kHz Stereo Audio frame (no CRC).

There are two versions of the program. (the Falcon do not support
44.1kHz sound without an (22.5792MHz) external clock)

    * mp2e.ttp is the external clock version with high sound quality.
    * mp2li.ttp uses linear interpolation for 44.1kHz to 49.17kHz
      conversion (no external clock is needed). This reduces sound
      quality significantly.

To be done:
    * mono
    * 32kHz and 48kHz
    * more bitrates (only 128kbit/sec and 192kbit/sec are tested,
                     others might work)
    * CRC check
