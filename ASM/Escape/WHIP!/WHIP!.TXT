0.NEWS

  There were a lot of people who asked me for a VGA-version of this program.
  So here it is. Other people asked me for the description of the vlm module
  format. So I decided to release the documentation and to improve the 
  comfort of the module interface a bit. There is a new module type for the
  ones, who are only interested in coding some nice effects without knowing
  anything about analysing sounds. For more information read 'vlmdocu.txt'.
                                 
1.OVERVIEW

  This program analysis music and creates visual effects out of the analysed
  sound. You have to connect a CD player or another audio source to the 
  microphone connector of your falcon to make use of this program.
  
2.HOW TO USE IT

  The usage of the program is very simple. On the left side of the screen
  are the sound controls. You can control the input volume the output volume
  and you can switch the internal speaker on or off. The input volume is
  very important to get good effects. It must not be too low or too high.
  The oscilloscope will help you to get good values. 
  The right side of the screen contains the visual effect controls. In the
  bottom of the information box there is the list of the available effects.
  Each list entry features three buttons. You can execute an effect by 
  clicking on the button with the name of the effect. By clicking on the
  infobutton of a list entry the right bottom box displays additional 
  information and provides parameter settings for the corresponding effect.
  The parameters are (like the whole program) just to play around with.
  There is another box on the right side of the screen which contains the
  feature to start a random slideshow of different effects. To start the
  show you have to click on the random-button. Using the other buttons you
  can set the time each effect is displayed. The random show uses only the
  effects that are 'enabled' you can disable an effect by clicking on the
  middle button of a effectlistentry. When an effect is running you can go
  back the the menuscreen using any key or a mousebutton. Press [Esc] to 
  leave the program or do not press [Esc] to not leave the program.
  
3.CONFIGURATION

  The program works on original 4Mb, 16Mhz Falcons with a rgb/tv/vga screen. 
  I do not know how it works with accelerators.
