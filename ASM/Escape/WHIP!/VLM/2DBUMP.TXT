Whip! 2D-Bumpmapper plugin v1.0



Okey, so I couldn't stay away from it ;)
This one is much more responsive to the audio than
the previous tunnel. 

No/Escape told me that the VBL is 50Hz always (even
if screen is 100..) so it functions well as a system-
timer for the fx.

Sorry about the source, no comments again and still
not that cleverly made. And there even is an obvious
speedup possible in the mainloop (kill the addq!).


Settings:
---------

X/Y Sinus speed:
 Faster/Slower movement of lightflare.
 
Timeslice:
 The higher it is, the longer it takes between each 
 new check of the volume. While it 'waits' for a new
 volume, it decreases (linear..) the current light-
 setting. So with a higher timeslice, you get nicer
 fade-backs, but less accurate to the audio!
 
Palette:
 Well not much to mention.
 
Steprate:
 Three modes, the normal one is good in most cases,
 the middle one rocks a bit more and the extreme
 one is for ravepartys only ;) If you use the
 middle/max setting, the brightness should be set
 lower than for normal, or you tend to have more or
 less a nonstop white screen.
 
Brightness:
 Doesn't need much explanation either..
