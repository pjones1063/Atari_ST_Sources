Yo guys,

NoBrain/NoCrew asked if I could make a tunnel for
the Whip VLM system. I thought why not, and made this.

It's nothing spectacular at all, just a normal tunnel
as you have seen a million times before, just that 
this one reacts to some sound and fits into Whip.

Sorry about the size of it, but the texture and
tunnel-offsets are stupid incbins.

The VLM source was easy to understand and use, I do
however miss a couple of things:

- A systemtimer to sync after. Now it will sync after
  updates not after a certain timeperiod.
  
- It is using BSS area for screenmem, now it isn't
  possible to use with fastram, wasting both framerate
  and the extra ram..


Settings:
---------

Scroll toggle
 If set to ON, it will toggle scroll direction of the
 tunnel surface texture depending on the volume
 
Rotation toggle
 If set to ON, it will toggle rotation direction of the
 tunnel surface texture depending on the volume
 
Scroll speed
 The larger the bar, the faster it will scroll
 
Rotation speed
 The larger the bar, the faster it will rotate
 
Scroll trigger
 The larger the bar, the harder to reach a scroll
 direction toggle
 
Rotation trigger
 The larger the bar, the harder to reach a rotation
 direction toggle
 
Timeslice
 The larger the bar, the longer time it will wait
 until checking for scroll/rot toggle again

Extras:

 I included the source in case someone like other defaults
 and another texture.. The .16b texture ia 128*128 16bit
 without header.. I know it is a horrible source, no comments
 or very smart coder in general..
