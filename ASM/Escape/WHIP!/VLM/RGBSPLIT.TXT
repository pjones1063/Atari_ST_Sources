RGB-Split plugin for Whip! VLM System.


This is a simple plugin with three layers responding
to the audiovolume. Red layer responds to left volume,
blue layer to right volume and green layer to mainvolume.

Once again, sorry for undocumented source, and it isn't
very optimized so maybe you can improve it.


Settings:
---------

Steprate (sensitivity):
 Three modes, normal, medium and HEFTIG. :)
 The heftig one should have low brightness on all
 three layers.

Brightness:
 One brightness for each layer, the green layer seems
 to "shine thru" the others a bit, so having the green
 one down a bit usually make it look nicer.
 
X/Y Sinus:
 Speed of the movement.
 
Timeslice:
 How often it should check for new values, the lower
 the value, the more often it checks. Higher values
 gives a nice scrollback of the colours, but gets
 less triggerhappy.
