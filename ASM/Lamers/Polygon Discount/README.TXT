Hi!

Sources of Polygon Discount demo relesed on Silly Venture 2k16 by Lamers for Atari Falcon 030 with 14MB.

Sources could be assemebled with vasm - update path in compile17.bat.
Additional PC tools/script (converters, table generators etc) are not included.
All effects in pipeline but without msx/gfx should run even on 2MB machine. Not sure if any effect standalone needs more than 1MB.
Code is as it was when before party - no clean up;) sorry!
This is my first (last? ehhh never say never) Falcon 030 code, so please be forgiving;)

What I think might be cool:
- I guess my gouraud and texture fillers are not bad as for pure 030 code (no DSP) considering I did it first time
- quite nice radix sort routine for face sorting (inside gouraud filler)
- guite proud of rotozoomer code which was the fastest I could figure out (100% realtime - no offset precalculation there)

Comments welcome! See you on #atariscne
