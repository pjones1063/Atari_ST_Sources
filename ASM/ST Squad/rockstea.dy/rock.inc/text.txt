SINCE YOU ARE BOTHERING TO READ THIS, I SUPPOSE THAT I HAD BETTER GIVE SOME INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS GAME...
ROCK STEADY IS JOYSTICK CONTROLLED.  (JOYSTICK PORT 1)    PRESS FIRE TO START.  COLLECT THE GEMS TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
EACH LEVEL HAS A PASSWORD, SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO START AGAIN AT THE BEGINNING IF YOU DIE!!
BE CAREFUL OF ROCKS AND BLUE DIAMONDS AS THEY WILL KILL YOU IF THEY FALL ON YOU!
GHOSTS WILL KILL YOU ON CONTACT BUT WILL YIELD DIAMONDS IF YOU DROP A ROCK ON THEM! (BLUE DIAMONDS WON'T WORK..)
PRESS FIRE WHILE YOU ARE BESIDE A SWITCH FOR VARIOUS EFFECTS.
ENTER THE SQUARES MARKED T TO TELEPORT AROUND THE LEVEL.  EXTRA LIVES EVERY 2000 POINTS.  COLLECT SMALL FACES FOR EXTRA LIVES.
COLLECT COINS FOR BONUS POINTS.
IF YOU GET INTO A POSITION THAT YOU CANNOT GET OUT OF, THEN PRESS Q TO RESTART THE LEVEL. (YOU LOSE A LIFE THOUGH!)
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO GET YOU STARTED - YOU CAN FIND THE REST OUT FOR YOURSELF.
LOOK OUT FOR AN EXPANDED VERSION WITH MANY MORE LEVELS, BETTER GRAPHICS, AND MORE FEATURES TO BE RELEASED SOON. (POSSIBLY THROUGH BUDGIE UK)
THIS VERSION IS A SMALL ONE FOR THIS DEMO, AS IF I PUT IN LOTS OF LEVELS, IT WOULD START TAKING UP HUGE AMOUNTS OF DISK SPACE...
GREAT GREETS TO THE REST OF INNER CIRCLE AND ALSO TO....  TLB, TCB, TEX, THE REST OF THE UNION (ESPECIALLY DELTA FORCE- GREAT SYNTAX TERROR DEMO.)
SYNC, OMEGA, THALION, AENIGMATICA, OVR (GREAT EURO DEMO), ESP, DELIGHT, POMPEY PIRATES, SEWER SOFTWARE,
DYNAMIC DUO, PENDRAGONS, ALLIANCES, HOTLINE, 
AND OTHER WORTHY PEOPLE I HAVE NEGLECTED IN MY SENILITY. (I AM ALMOST OLD ENOUGH TO GO TO UNIVERSITY!!!!)
YES, THIS A FULL GAME WITH IN-GAME DIGI-SOUND MUSIC.  THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY GAMES THAT CAN BOAST THAT... (OK, OK, SO SAPIENS HAD DIGI-MUSIX AGES AGO, BUT YOU MUST ALLOW ME SOME EGOTISTICAL BULLSHIT....)
IF YOU DON`T LIKE THIS GAME THEN SOD OFF, PRESS F10, AND LOAD ONE OF THE OTHER SCREENS.
PLEASE LIKE IT, OR I MAY HAVE TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY SLASHING MY WRISTS WITH A BANANA...
I LIKE IT AS I WAS A FAN OF THE C64 ORIGINAL (BOULDERDASH) SO ANYONE WHO THINKS IT IS TOO SIMPLE CAN ---- ---.
(MESSAGE CENSORED TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT)
IF YOU DON`T HAVE A JOYSTICK, THEN -GO AND BUY ONE-. THIS GAME CAN BE PLAYED WITH THE CURSOR KEYS AND SPACEBAR, BUT I WOULDN`T ADVISE IT....
I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER GAMES IN PROGRESS, SO KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR THEM.....
ANYONE WHO THINKS THE CODING IN THIS GAME IS RUBBISH, CAN -GO JUMP IN A LAKE-.
THE CODE HAS NOT BEEN OPTIMISED AT ALL, SO IT IS NOT A MODEL OF SPEED.
(I HAD TO ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN THE DIGIMUSIC PLAYER AS IT CLASHED WITH MY KEYBOARD INTERRUPT!!!!)

WELL, I AM SURE YOU WANT TO GET ON WITH PLAYING THE GAME, SO....  WRAP TIME!!!!
