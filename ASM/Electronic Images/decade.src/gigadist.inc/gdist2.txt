WHAT CAN I TALK ABOUT NOW...LET'S THINK...I KNOW, LET'S TALK
ABOUT US..THE ST-SQUAD......

IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO (EARLY 1989) WHEN I BROUGHT THE REPLAY 4	SAMPLER.
IT WAS NOT LONG TILL I WAS PLAYING AROUND WITH SAMPLED STUFF AND I STARTED TO PUT TOGETHER A POWER BASIC PROGRAM TO DO A DEMO
(I HAD SEEN THE B.I.G. DEMO AT THAT TIME).
WELL WE SAW THAT ANYTHING SERIOUS HAD TO BE IN MACHINE CODE.
EVENTUALlY WE GOT DEVPAC AND SAW IT WAS GOOD.
AFTER 2 DAYS FROM KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT THE 68000 AND ST HARDWARE, MATRIXX WROTE HIS FIRST SCROLLER.
IT WAS NOT EXACTLY THE BEST SCROLLER BUT IT WAS A START.
THEN CAME THE GHOSTBUSTERS DEMO, FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY OUR OTHER TWO SAMPLE MIXES.
THE 007 DEMO WHICH HAD THE GRAPHICS DONE BY THEN NEW MEMBER MASTER.
AFTER THAT CAME THE MOST TECHNICALLY IMPRESSIVE WE HAD EVER DONE.
IT WAS CODED IN ONE DAY ROUND AT MY HOUSE (ST-SQUAD HQ), UNLIKE YE OLDE GHOSTBUSTERS WHICH TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS.
WELL HERE IS ONE OF THE FIRST REALLY SERIOUS BITS OF CODING THAT THE ST-SQUAD HAS EVER DONE, AND MAY BE OUR LAST FOR SOME TIME.
WE ARE NOW STARTING TO WRITE GAMES TO EARN SOME MONEY.
OUR FIRST GAME IS COMING ALONG (ALBA AN EVEN NEWER MEMBER IS DOING THE GRAPHICS).
HOPEFULLY WHEN WE CAN AFFORD IT WE WILL DO SOME MORE DEMOS.
KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THE GAMES (WITH PROTECTION THAT EVEN ANDY CAN'T CRACK! (i bet he can - matrixx)) SO BUY IT.
WELL THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE HARDEST SCROLLS TO READ SO I THINK WE SHOULD WRAP SOON.
YOUR EYES ARE PROBaBLY BLEEDING BY NOW BUT WHO CARES!!!.
AT LEAST THE helix SCROLL IS EASIER ON THE EYES.
WELL HERE WE GO, LETS WRAP.......

err, no we are not... this is matrixx here again and i want to write something in this scroller.
i am getting fed up with the message in the byte bender, but having said that i can't think of anything to write i have not mentioned before.
okay, let`s rap... boom, boom-boom chak-chak, boom, boom-boom. err, sorry, i don't mean rap, i mean wrap.......
ON SECOND THOUGHTS I THINK THAT I WILL STOP..
