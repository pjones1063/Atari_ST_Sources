
YES, IT'S MATRIXX HERE.
DAMN, NOW I HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING THAT I CAN WRITE IN THIS SCROLLING MESSAGE..

OKAY, I'LL DO SOME CREDITS.
IDEA, CODING, WAVEFORMS, TEXT, SPRITE GRAPHIX, ETC. ETC. BY ME. HE HE HO HO... SORRY....
RASTERS DESIGNED AND MAIN FONT POLISHED BY MASTER.
THIS FONT IS BY ALBA. (THIS FONT IS ACTUALLY FROM OUR GAME..)
THE MEGA MUSIX IS OF COURSE BY COUNT ZERO OF ELECTRONIC IMAGES.

CAN YOU ACTUALLY READ THIS?  I HAVE A LITTLE PROCESSOR TIME LEFT, BUT I THINK THAT THE SCREEN IS CROWDED ENOUGH AS IT IS.
ANYTHING MORE AND THINGS WILL GET UNREADABLE.  GRIFF SAYS THAT I SHOULD TAKE OUT THE STS LOGO'S ABOVE THIS AS IT LOOKS BETTER,
BUT THEN I WASTE EVEN MORE PROCESSOR TIME...

ENOUGH OF THAT, I'M GOING TO GREET A FEW PEOPLE.
]
ARCHIE ALREADY HAS A FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE GREETS LIST IN THE SCROLL BEHIND THIS ONE, SO I'LL JUST SAY HI TO...

ELECTRONIC IMAGES.
THE RESISTANCE. (EXCELLENT FULL-SCREENS, GRIFF!!!!!!)
THE FINGERBOBS. 
THE DYNAMIC DUO.
ALL DUNGEON MASTER FREAKS OUT THERE, LIKE DAVID (HI THERE), MARK (HI THERE), NICK (HI THERE) AND ARCHIE'S BROTHER... (THIS DUNGEON MASTER FREAK CATEGORY INCLUDES ME...)
AND ANYONE ELSE I MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN. (CHECK OUT THE GREETS ON THE HELIX SCROLL...)

I GOT THE 'SO WATT' DEMO A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND I MUST SAY THAT IT IS REALLY GOOD.
(HI TO EVERYBODY WHO WAS INVOLVED IN IT)
UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE JUST NOTICED THAT VECTOR'S RESET-DEMO HAS A SCROLL VERY MUCH LIKE THE ONE IN THE BACKGROUND OF THIS DEMO.
DRAT... OH WELL, THEIR SCROLL IS ONLY ONE BIT PLANE. (NICE DEMO THOUGH, VECTOR.)

ON THE SUBJECT OF THE 'SO WATT' DEMO - A QUICK MESSAGE TO THE DEMO REVIEWER FOR A MAGAZINE THAT WILL REMAIN ANONYMOUS, WHO THOUGH THAT THE 'SO WATT' DEMO HAD THREE SCREENS.
TO HIM I SEND THE MESSAGE - SCREENS CALLED 'MAIN MENUS' ARE USUALLY CALLED THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE MENUS......

FOR ONCE I HAVE COMPLETELY COMMENTED THE SOURCE CODE FOR THIS DEMO. (AMAZING, IS IT NOT?)
BUT, NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT. (UNLESS YOU ARE A MEMBER OF INNER CIRCLE OR ASK VERY NICELY......)

I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN BE BOTHERED TO WRITE MUCH MORE TEXT AS I HAVE A SPLITTING HEADACHE,
A COLD, A SORE THROAT, I AM TIRED OUT, I HAVE JUST READ ARCHIE'S TEXT (DEPRESSING HUH?),
I HAVE GOT SOME CHEMISTRY HOMEWORK TO DO, I HAVE JUST HAD A NASTY MATHS TEST, AND MY ST HAS JUST SLOWED DOWN.
HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY BL--DY ST? HELP.... HOLD IT, I'LL JUST REBOOT.
THAT'S BETTER.  I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED, I CAN'T FIND ANY VIRUSES ON ANY OF MY DISKS... OH, WELL....
