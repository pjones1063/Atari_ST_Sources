OK, IT HAD TO HAPPEN... WHAT DID??  I DON'T KNOW!!!!  RIGHT THEN, WHO IS THIS YOU ALL CRY!? WELL, IT ISN'T YOUR USUAL QUIM, ITS MEGA QUIM HIMSELF....
- MASTER -     SO WHAT DID I DO FOR THIS SCREEN?? WHAT DO YOU CARE?! ALL I DID WAS THE CRAPPY DISTING LOGO... AND A BIT OF RASTER COLOURS... BUT THAT'S IT!!
(A BIG HELP EH!)... TO STOP YOU GOING AWAY AND DOING OTHER -THINGS- LIKE SEEING THE SCREENS, OR SOMETHING BY YOURSELF PRIVATELY(!!), I WILL NOW BORE YOU WITH A
BIT OF THE USUAL BULLSHITEEEE.. OOOOH... I CAN HEARTILY RECOMMEND SHEEPSKIN UNDERWEAR... HELPS INSULATE THE WOOL...    ALSO HOW ABOUT SOME BARBED WIRE PANTY
LINERS???   OR NIPPLELESS BRAS???   SCROTUMLESS BRIEFS???    HEY! WHAT IS THIS?? NOT PROPER BULLSHIT... PROPER BULLSHIT FOR THE CODERS AMONGST YOU OUT THERE IS
TO SAY THAT THIS SCREEN IS IN FACT OVERSCANNING, AND IS USING THE HARDWARE SCROLL FOR ALL THE ONE PLANE STUFF, AND HAS 4096 COLOURS ENABLED BUT WE DIDN'T WANT
TO OVERDO IT... SO THIS IS WHAT YOU GET...     OTHERS OF YOU WILL SAY WHEN YOU SEE THIS SCREEN, WAIT A SEC, HAVEN'T WE SEEN THAT SORT OF SCROLLER BEFORE LIKE IN
THE DEMOSCREEN BY PHALANX - BUT ONE THING IS, THIS SCREEN IS ABOUT 6 MONTHS OLD - AND NO, THAT ISN'T A SWELLHEAD COMMENT EITHER!!! ANYWAY, HELLO TO PHALANX
ANYWAY - IT REALLY PISSED MATRIXX OFF WHEN HE SAW THE VERTICAL 1 PLANE DISTING SCROLL THAT YOU DID... BUT WE STILL DECIDED TO THROW THIS SCREEN IN FOR THE LOVE
