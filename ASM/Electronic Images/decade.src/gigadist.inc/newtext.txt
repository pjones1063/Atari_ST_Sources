
YUP, IT'S MATRIXX HERE POUNDING AWAY AT THE KEYBOARD AT HALF PAST ONE IN THE MORNING.
THE NIGHT (MORNING?) IS STILL YOUNG SO I HAD BETTER GET DOWN TO SOME SERIOUS TEXT WRITING...

IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED YET, THIS IS THE GIGADIST DEMO FROM MATRIXX OF THE ST-SQUAD.

THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE THE THIRD TIME THAT I HAVE HAD TO WRITE A SCROLLTEXT FOR THIS DEMO.
THIS DEMO WAS WRITTEN OVER SIX MONTHS AGO AND MOST OF THE STUFF I PUT IN THE ORIGINAL SCROLL TEXTS IS NOW COMPLETELY OUT OF DATE SO I'VE HAD TO RE-WRITE THE WHOLE LOT.

BEFORE I FORGET, HERE ARE A FEW CREDITS...
IDEA, CODING, WAVEFORMS, TEXT, SPRITE GRAPHICS, ETC. ETC. BY MATRIXX. (THAT'S ME, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVN'T BEEN PAYING ANY ATTENTION)

THIS FONT IS BY ALBA OF S.T.S. (IT IS ACTUALLY TAKEN FROM OUR FORTHCOMING GAME)

RASTERS AND THE LOGO AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN DRAWN BY MASTER.

THIS MEGA MUSIC WAS OF COURSE COMPOSED AND CODED BY COUNT ZERO OF ELECTRONIC IMAGES (WHO ELSE?).

GREETS GO TO .....

COUNT ZERO OF ELECTRONIC IMAGES (A MAN OF A THOUSAND MUSIX....)
GRIFF OF THE RESISTANCE (GREAT FULLSCREENS AND THREE-D STUFF)
THE PHANTOM OF ELECTRONIC IMAGES (UNUSUAL SCREEN.....)
ROGGIE OF THE RESISTANCE. 
MASTER (FLASH GRAPHICS)
LOTUS OF HOTLINE (I LIKED YOUR FOUR HOUR DEMO!)
SENSE OF HOTLINE (BRILLIANT GRAPHICS)
THE RED HERRINGS (GREAT DEMO)
THE FINGERBOBS (AGAIN, GREAT DEMO... THE DECADE DEMO IS GETTING FULL OF GREAT DEMOS.....)
 
GREETS TO - ALL OF THE UNION (IF IT STILL EXISTS)..... ALL CREWS WHO MADE THE SO WATT DEMO....

WELL, THOSE TWO COVER MOST GREETS BUT ALSO HI TO ...........
DYNAMIC DUO.... HISOFT (DEVPAC IS THE BEST, DESPITE OTHER MEMBERS OF I.C. LIKING THE VERY FAST TURBO ASSEMBLER...)
ALLIANCE, THE EMPIRE, SEWER SOFT, POMEY PIRATES, T.L.B. (EVEN THOUGH THE DECADE DEMO IS BETTER THAN MINDBOMB...) AND ANYONE ELSE I HAVE FORGOTTEN (I HAVE A SPLITTING HEADACHE AT THE MOMENT AND CAN'T REMEMBER WHO TO GREET.)

THE KOPITE OF G-FORCE WHO CAME DOWN TO THE THIRD I.C. COPY PARTY (HELD AS USUAL AT COUNT ZERO'S.) (HAS G-FORCE BEEN SLAGGED OFF MORE THAN ANY OTHER CREW????)

I KEEP HAVING TO REWRITE THIS DEMO.... AT THE START OF THE THIRD I.C. COPY PARTY I THOUGHT THAT I HAD IT FINISHED,
BUT THEN GRIFF TOLD ME THAT HE THOUGHT THAT THE BLOCKS I HAD IN THE MIDDLE LOOKED CRAP.
I AGREED WITH HIM SO I PUT IN THE DISTORTING LOGO.

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO THINK THAT I AM CHEATING, THE LOGO AND THE BACKGROUND SCROLL ARE BOTH THREE-PLANE.


IF YOU WANT TO CONTACT US, USE THE ADDRESS IN ONE OF ARE OTHER (NOT VERY GOOD) DEMOS.


NOW I THINK THAT I HAD BETTER, ERRRR, WHAT WAS THAT WORD?
YOU KNOW... THE ONE THAT MEANS THAT THIS MESSAGE GOES BACK TO THE START....
AH, YES, LOOP (WAS THAT IT?).........

SORRY..  NO LOOP...  THE KOPITE HAS BUTTED IN HERE..   HI GUYS...  
THIS SCREEN IS GREAT ISN'T IT..   WOW..  JUST LOOK AT THE SCROLLERS...  
BETTER THAT ANY SHITTY MINDBOMB SCREEN..   BANG...AAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHH... HA HA HA THE KOPITE HAS BEEN SHOT...
MATRIXX HERE RECLAIMING HIS SCROLLER....
