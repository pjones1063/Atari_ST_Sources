HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE HELIX SCROLLER.  THIS SCREEN WAS CODED BY MATRIXX OF THE ST-SQUAD AND THE FONT WAS DRAWN BY MASTER.
THE VOLUME DIALS WERE DRAWN BY ALBA.

OKAY, THIS DEMO IS A LITTLE LAME, BUT I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE TO PUT IN THIS DEMO AS I DON'T HAVE ANY SCREEN SPACE LEFT.....

OH DEAR, FOR ONCE I AM COMPLETELY STUCK FOR ANYTHING INTERESTING TO SAY IN A SCROLLING MESSAGE.
I MANAGED A FIFTY-FOUR KB (THIS ------- FONT DOESN'T HAVE NUMBERS) 
SCROLLER FOR OUR FIRST GHOSTBUSTERS DEMO, BUT I NOW CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY FOR EVEN A SHORT SCROLLER.  WELL, I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH SOME DOTS AND DASHES TO DEMONSTRATE THIS SCROLL WHILE I THINK OF SOMTHING TO SAY.
.................................... ----------------------------------- OH, YES, I ALMOST FORGOT, HOW ABOUT SOME GREETINGS... FIRSTLY, MEGA MEGA GREETS TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF INNER CIRCLE --- ELECTRONIC IMAGES
(ESPECIALLY COUNT ZERO WHO HELD THE COPY PARTY WHERE MOST OF THIS DEMO SCREEN WAS WRITTEN),  THE RESISTANCE (GREAT PARALLAX SCROLLER), THE DYNAMIC DUO WHO POPPED IN ON THE COPY PARTY FOR A FEW HOURS, AND THE FINGERBOBS WHO I HAVEN'T MET YET.....
O.K. LETS GREET SOME OTHER CREWS AND PEOPLE NOW - HI TO....... THE UNION
(THE CAREBEARS, THE EXCEPTIONS, TNT-CREW, DELTA FORCE, LEVEL SIXTEEN ETC. AND OF COURSE THE REPLICANTS.)
THE LOST BOYS, THE WEST GERMAN ALLIANCE (THANKS FOR THE LETTER - I HOPE YOU GOT ARCHIE'S LETTER), F.O.F.T. (ESPECIALLY STARTIDE INTERNATIONAL (IS THAT RIGHT?)), DELIGHT (NICE MEETING YOU AT THE SHOW),
THE ANTI-SOCIALS AND FINALLY THE SKUNK.
OH YES, A QUICK HI TO MATHEW MILES WHO PHONED US AT THREE A.M. ON HIS MODEM AT THE COPY PARTY TO HAVE A CHAT AND ASKED US TO GREET HIM.
THIS MAY BE THE LAST DEMO FOR THE ST-SQUAD FOR A LITTLE WHILE (EXCEPT MAYBE FOR A MEG BAT DEMO AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS) AS I HAVE IDEAS FOR FOUR GAMES,
WHICH I FEEL I REALLY MUST GET AROUND TO CODING ONE OF THESE DAYS.  THEY MAY BE COMMERCIAL IF ANY SOFTWARE HOUSES ARE INTERESTED,
BUT IF NOT THEY WILL BE RELEASED ON THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.  THE FIRST TWO ARE FAIRLY SIMPLE AND MAY BE P.D. (THOUGH I HAVE JUST HAD SOME IDEAS FOR MORE FEATURES)
ONE IS SORT OF A VERSION OF ATIC ATAC AND THE OTHER IS A VARIANT OF PAC-MAN.  THE OTHER TWO SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED,
ONE A SHOOT-EM-UP AND THE OTHER A DIFFERENT TYPE OF GAME I AM SAYING NOTHING ABOUT, EXCEPT THAT IT WILL PROBABLY HAVE VERTICAL PARALLAX SCROLLING.

LET'S GO ONTO ANOTHER TOPIC.... I HAVE HEARD FROM E.I. THAT THE STE IS RATHER INCOMPATABLE WITH THE STANDARD ST AND A LOT OF DEMO-CODER'S PROGRAMMING TRICKS LIKE HARDWARE SCROLLING AND OVERSCAN WILL SOMETIMES FAIL IF YOU AREN'T CAREFUL.
I TRIED AN OLD VERSION OF THIS DEMO ON A FOUR MEG STE AT THE SIXTEEN BIT COMPUTER FAIR AND THE OVERSCAN ALMOST WORKS.
I HAVE ALTERED THE CODE SLIGHTLY SINCE THEN SO I HAVE NO IDEA IF THE BOTTOM BORDER OVERSCAN FOR THIS DEMO WILL WORK ON AN STE.
IF YOU ARE RUNNING THIS DEMO ON AN STE AND THIS SCROLL DOES NOT GO OVER THE BOTTOM BORDER, SORRY.....


ADMITTEDLY, THE STE HAS BUILT-IN SUPPORT FOR HARDWARE SCROLLING AND HAS A BLITTER, BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A TOTAL PAIN IN THE NECK CODING FOR IT AS DEMOS ARE GOING TO NEED TWEEKING TO RUN PROPERLY ON IT.
APPARENTLY, MOST OF THE CAREBEARS STUFF WON'T EVEN BOOT PROPERLY ON IT.  OH, WELL, I'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I CAN GET MY HANDS ON ONE TO SEE HOW GOOD IT REALLY IS...

OH YES, SORRY TO EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DEMO.  IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A NEW YEAR DEMO, BUT IT HAS GOT DELAYED AND I AM NOW WRITING THIS MESSAGE ON THE TENTH OF MARCH.
 
I AM GETTING TO THE STAGE WHERE I HAVE SO MANY DISKS I HAVE TERRIBLE TROUBLE FINDING THE ONE I WANT.
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SORTED BUT I NEVER CAN REMEMBER HOW I SORTED THEM....
IF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WHICH DOESN'T INVOLVE BUYING A HARD DISK I WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR OF IT.....


IF YOU WANT TO CONTACT US, ARCHIE'S ADDRESS IS IN THE GIGA-DIST SCREEN.

I THINK I AM GOING TO HAVE TO BUY A COPY OF CHAOS STRIKES BACK... IT LOOKS TOO GOOD TO MISS.

I HAD BETTER WRAP UP THIS MESSAGE SOON AS I STILL HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE TO PUT IN THIS DEMO. (THIS DEMO JUST HAS THE SCROLLER IN IT AT THE MOMENT)

THIS MESSAGE WILL GO BOOM IN FIVE SECONDS...
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE,            BOOM             I TOLD YOU....
