PLAYMPEG (c) Martin GRIFFiths 1994.

Version History
---------------

v0.4
- First release version, betatest -> lots of problems.

v0.5 (not released)
- MPEG file detection added -> no trying to play text files now!
- Bug causing an occasionally crash at the restart of an MPEG fixed!
- 20% faster (due to complete rewrite of DSP IDCT), and over 30% in VGA.
- 'No press any key prompt to start the MPEG', just a 3 second delay instead, (the registered
  version has the delay removed).
- Displays 'average frames per second' on exit. 
- Now handles non-default intra matrix (stored within MPEG -> but very rare).
- MPEG stream error checks added, can't crash due to errors in MPEG video stream.

v0.6
- Lots check code and minor bug fixes (don't allow running on a mono monitor, file read errors etc).
- Improvements in Huffman decoder, better DSP CPU parallelism - 5% speed increase.
  (17.62 FPS on MJACKSON.MPG in VGA (greyscale) 12.83 fps full colour :-)
- Hopefully restores screen mode correctly on exit = there were problems with screenblaster
  (Please report if this is still not correct.)
v0.65
- Now skips non-intra frames, so it will play ALL Mpegs files, but obviously with 'jumps' between 
  frametypes that are not supported.
- Speed increase, (IDCT again :-). (MJACKSON.MPG is now 13.03 fps full colour).
v0.66 
- Restores screen resolution hardware registers directly, so it should FINALLY work with screenblaster, blowup
  or any other wacky screen res enhancer you use this program with).
v0.67
- Supports higher res MPEGs (i.e. 352x240 etc) -> max res is now 480x384 (limit of true colour on VGA).
- Some more tidying up of the error recovery code.
v0.68 
- No annoying .LOD file now,the DSP code is held within main binary :-).
- End of MPEG detection improved. 
- Grayscale version made 30% faster (removal of CR/CB IDCT).

To do:

- Command line options (double sized pixels, frame rate limiting etc),
- TT versions and perhaps even an STE version :-).
