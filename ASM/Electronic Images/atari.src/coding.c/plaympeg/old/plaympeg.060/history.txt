PLAYMPEG (c) Martin GRIFFiths 1994.

Version History
---------------

v0.4
- First release version, betatest -> lots of problems.

v0.5 (not released)
- MPEG file detection added -> no trying to play text files now!
- Bug causing an occasionally crash at the restart of an MPEG fixed!
- 20% faster (due to complete rewrite of DSP IDCT), and over 30% of VGA.
- 'No press any key prompt to start the MPEG', just a 3 second delay instead, (the registered
  version has the delay removed).
- Displays 'average frames per second' on exit. 
- Now handles non-default intra matrix (stored within MPEG -> but very rare).
- MPEG stream error checks added, can't crash due to errors in MPEG video stream.

v0.6
- Lots check code and minor bug fixes (don't allow running on a mono monitor, file read errors etc).
- Improvements in Huffman decoder, better DSP CPU parallelism - 5% speed increase.
  (17.62 FPS on MJACKSON.MPG in VGA TRUECOLOUR :-)
- Hopefully restores screen mode correctly on exit = there were problems with screenblaster
  (Please report if this is still not correct.)

Coming in v0.7...

- Command line options (double sized pixels, frame rate limiting etc),
- A minimum of 30% faster (believe me!)
- TT versions and perhaps even an STE version :-).
