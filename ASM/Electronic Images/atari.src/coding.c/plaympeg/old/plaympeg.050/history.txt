PLAYMPEG (c) Martin GRIFFiths 1994.

Version History
---------------

v0.4
- First release version, betatest -> lots of problems.

v0.5 (not released)
- MPEG file detection added -> no trying to play text files now!
- Bug causing an occasionally crash at the restart of an MPEG fixed!
- 25% faster and uses less RAM (due to complete rewrite of DSP IDCT).
- 'No press any key prompt to start the MPEG', just a 3 second delay instead, (the registered
  version has the delay removed).
- Displays 'frames per second' on exit. 
- Now handles non-default intra matrix (stored within MPEG -> but very rare).
- MPEG stream error checks added, can't crash due to errors in MPEG video stream.

To do:-
- More MPEG stream checks (esp. Huffman decoder).
- Grayscale version can be > 25% faster (skip CRCB colour data -> removes 1/3 of the IDCTs!)
- Command line options (double pixel resolution/no loop etc).
