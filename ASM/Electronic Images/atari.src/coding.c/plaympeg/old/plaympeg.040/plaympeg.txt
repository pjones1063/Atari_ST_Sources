PLAYMPEG 0.4

Ok... heres a very fast Falcon MPEG decoder.
This one is about 12 times faster than the other 
Falcon MPEG player since the player is written in
assembler and uses DSP. It only handle MPEG
Intra-frames (95% of MPEGs are of this type anyway)
and displays only in greyscale. (11-20 FPS average!)
You can get a full colour version by sending a 
few pounds or a few disks to the below address.  
(Alternatively you can pay several thousand pounds to
Brainstorm for their Mpeg decoder ;-) ).
