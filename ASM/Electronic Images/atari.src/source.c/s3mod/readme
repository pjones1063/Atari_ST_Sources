This is s3mod for Linux. It is a MOD/S3M tracker file player.  This
should play 4,6,or 8 track MOD file format tracker files. It also
should play Scream Tracker 3 (S3M) files.

This version also includes the first release of GUS native support.
This can be turned off by using the "-g" switch. (then it'll just 
play though /dev/dsp even if you have a GUS)

Email any bugs you find to
				dlm40629@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu
				or
				jeske@intlink.net

We know that 16bit /dev/dsp support is not as clean as it should/could
be. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let us know.

THANKS TO:

Most recently, thanks to the authors of GMOD. It was essential
in my learning to understand the /dev/sequencer "VoxWare" drivers.
	( Hannu Savolainen and Andrew J. Robinson )

Thanks to Carlos Hasan for releasing source to his mod player.

Thanks also to those who wrote Vangelis Tracker, and for those at
Future Crew for making the S3M file format. Lastly, thanks to Skaven
and Purple Motion of Future Crew for releasing so many great S3Ms to
listen to.

Some internal thanks to Brandon Long for initiating the port of this
to Linux, and to David Jeske for miscelanous debugging work and things
like this README file.
