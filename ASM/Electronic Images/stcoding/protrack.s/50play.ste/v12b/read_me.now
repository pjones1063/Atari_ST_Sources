Instructions
------------

To use this module player :-

1. Simply Install '50PLAY.PRG' as an application on the desktop for the 
   extension '.MOD'. Modules can then be played by double clicking on them.

OR
--

2. Rename '50PLAY.PRG' to '50PLAY.TTP" . To play a module double click on 
'50PLAY.TTP'and type the module name at the command line prompt.

       When playing a module you can use <F1> - <F10> to control the sliders
and <T> to toggle TEMPO control on and off. Tempo control need only be turned
off for very old modules.  (An old module will normal play at the wrong speed
if tempo control is set to ON. You should set tempo control to OFF as soon as
the module starts playing if it plays incorrectly with tempo control on.)


ProTracker V2.1a Replay Features
--------------------------------

- 50KHZ STE stereo output. 
- Full Compatibility with ALL NoiseTrackers upto NT2.0 (Amiga).
- Compatible with Protracker 1.0 - 2.1a (Nov '92 Amiga version.).
- The only player to feature all Protracker commands.
- After lots of requests now does 'CIA timing', which means it is the ONLY
  player that can play modules using the TEMPO command!
- This player doesn't have a flash graphical front-end, nor is it meant to.
  The program is written to take as little space as possible.
  (58k memory resident ,or about 18k on disk(even less if packed...)
- It does not 'pad' the samples to gain extra cpu time like most players.
  - this saves memory and means modules are always replayed accurately.
  - the player simply 'emulates' the Amiga Paula soundchip.
