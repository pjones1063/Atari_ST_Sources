
    A few tips & tricks on how to use the Mr Music MODule convertor.

     By:  The Phantom of Electronic Images.



   First  of  all,  I  must say that this  is  a  really  crap  convertor 
considering the size of the files it produces.  This is because I haven't 
(yet?)  used the pattern loop feature in Mr Music and the fact  that  MOD 
files work in a completely different system from Mr Music.  Maybe someone 
will be kind enough to do one??   Anyway,  there are two source files  on 
disk:
     CONVMOD5.S     - Latest version - produces standard Mr Music SNG.
     CONVMOD6.S     - For speed-freaks;  gives about 1-2% extra CPU,  but 
                      needs the modified MR_MUSIC.XRF file.

First  of  all,  some limitations.   If the MOD file starts on  an  empty 
channel,  it'll probably bugger up the SNG file.   What you have to do is 
this.   Say the fist pattern in the MOD file (when you play it,  NOT when 
it has just been loaded!) has this:

     Channel 1      Channel 2      Channel 3      Channel 4
     C#3            ---------      A              ---------
     D              C#1            A              ---------

Channels 2 and 4 start off blank.  What you have to do is put in a VOLUME 
command of 0 at the start of the blank channel, so it then reads:

     Channel 1      Channel 2      Channel 3      Channel 4
     C#3            ------C00      A              ------C00
     D              C#1            A              ---------

Note  that  this  ONLY applies to the first  pattern  played,  not  every 
pattern, and also to the first entry (0 of 0-63) of the pattern.
  The MOD converter does not convert slides, volume changes etc etc, just 
ignores them.   It DOES convert a volume command of 0; it interprets this 
as  'instrument  off'  (so it is handy for  turning  off  a  string,  for 
example).

  HOW TO CONVERT:

  First of all,  you have to load the module into a suitable tracker  and 
save out ALL the samples (signed) that are used;  it is best to name them 
according to their position, so the first sample you save out as '1.SPL', 
the second as '2.SPL', etc etc.  Any blank samples you skip, so if sample 
3 is empty,  you dont save it,  but you STILL name sample number four  as 
'4.SPL',  not '3.SPL',  and so on.   Any LOOPED samples you take note of.  
Personally I put an 'L' in the filename,  so I don't forget it's a looped 
sample (e.g.  '3L.SPL').   Note that looped samples have to be set  using 
Quartet's 'DIGITAL.PRG' (which is great since you can have smoother loops 
than in the MOD file using the ramp function).

Then,  depending on the quality of the sound you want,  you can do either 
of the following:

Reasonable quality but quick to do:
   First,  make  the  samples proper AVR  samles.   Load  these  up  into 
Quartet's 'DIGITAL.PRG' and then save them out, taking note of the looped 
samples!
   Make  a Quartet .SET file out of the samples.   Sample '1.AVR'  is  in 
entry 1,  sample '3.AVR' in entry 3 etc etc.  Leave out any blank samples 
(so  if in the MOD file sample number 5 is blank,  you leave it blank  in 
the .SET file).   Then you run the SETCONVT.PRG program on the .SET  file 
to make a Mr Music .EIT file.  You then load up one of the MOD converters 
and  change  the destination filename (for the SNG file) and  the  source 
file name (of the .MOD file) at the bottom of the source file.   Run  it.  
You now have a converted .MOD file in the form of an EIT and a SNG  file!  
Please  note that any SNG files made using the fast-player converter  are 
not  compatible with the normal Mr Music player.   It is best  to  rename 
these to .SNF instead of .SNG.

Excellent (sounds like 16Khz!) quality but quite slow to do:
   As  above,  but first you must do this:   convert every  sample  using 
Quartet's  'DIGITAL.PRG'  from 16Khz to 11Khz.   This  brilliant  program 
converts the sample into a waveform, and loses almost no quality when you 
make the sample 11Khz!


O.K.  That is about it.  If you have any suggestions, keep 'em!  I really 
hate  the .MOD file format,  and if anyone is kind enough to do a  proper 
convertor,  then  pleeeease do so!   I'll be working instead on a  CUBASE 
converter (with a friend) since Count Zero now uses Cubase to compose his 
music (and it's more like Mr Music too)!!!

Anyway, have fun!
