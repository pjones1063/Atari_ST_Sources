NoisePakker is a packing system to pack samples and soundtracker
modules. Packratios of 50% on samples are guaranteed! The basic
algorithm is a lossy algorithm, but usually the quality of your
samples is even improved.

Try packing your NoisePakked files with Ice Packer, you'll get amazing
results afterwards. 70% average packratio on modules!
