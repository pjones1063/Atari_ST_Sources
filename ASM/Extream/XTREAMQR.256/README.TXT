256b moving QR code by Emphii / eXtream, 11.-13.11.2022

Quickly put together 256 bytes entry to Silly Venture 2022 Winter Edition,
held 8.-11.12. in Gdansk, Poland.

This intro runs on regular Atari Falcon 030/16Mhz/RGB|TV, no VGA this time,
sorry about that.

I recommend to turn power off and on after watching this intro.
