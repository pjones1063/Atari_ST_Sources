      -O- 128 Byte Virtual 303 -O-

Next in  my  ongoing  series of 128 byte
intros,    I  present  a  Roland  TB-303
emulator in 128 bytes.

This legendary  synth  started  the acid
craze back in  the  80s,  and  has since
become   a   valuable   collector  item.
Emulate the  sound  of  this  classic on
your Atari homecomputer.

filter cutoff of  your  very own virtual
303!!

     synthesiser with adjustable cutoff
 *  Bad-ass 303 acid tone
 *  Optimised  code  runs  on  any Atari
     16/32 computer

Squeal piggy squeal!
