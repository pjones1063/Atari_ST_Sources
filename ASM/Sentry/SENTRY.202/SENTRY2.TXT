Well, folks.

This is a new version of the Sentry-Packer. The only packer which is save for
packing bussiness programs, utilities, etc.
If a program packed with Ice-Pack 2.40 or lower, Atomic 3.3 or lower, Jam 4.0
or lower and all other great packers, will not work, don't worry.
The sentry-packer will pack it and it will work! Nearly all packers have
problems packing GFA-Basic Compilations, Turbo C Compilations and other
C Compilations, but the Sentry-Packer CAN pack them!
With maximum offset ($2320) it will pack, for as far as I know as good as
Atomic 3.3 (some times better, some times worse) and better than Ice.

Eagle of Sentry.
