Information File on the SentryPacker v2.11

As I forgot to update and fix the DEPACK Function of the SentryPacker v2.10,
and TEXT Segments could still be ODD (Not in GemDos), I had to make an update
on the two days ago released version 2.10.

To be sure there would be NO trouble AT ALL, with this version, I tested about
140 Files (Data & Program) with lengths between ca. 400 Bytes and 180Kb.
There was NOT A SINGLE BIT changed after packing, testing, depackin and testing
again. This could lead to the conclusion that the packer is very save to use.
There were two bugs in the older depacker-routines, the first one crashed the
packer if you depacked more that 1 file, the second made it impossible to
depack files any bigger that ca. 32 Kb.

If you have a file that does NOT work after you packed it, I would be
delighted to hear from you (Wich is probably never). Send me the original and
at least the corrupted File, so I can try to do something about the problem.

If you want to contact me for any reason (it has to be a decent one), you can
contact me on:
