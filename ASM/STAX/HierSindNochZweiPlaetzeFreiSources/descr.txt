here are some sources from the demo "Hier sind noch zwei Pl√§tze frei" by Stax and Inter
(https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1590)

I'm quite sure these are not the latest sources (I think it was originally meant to be
linked and processed as a disc image by a Stax member but in the end I have done all 
of the work and these changes are not included here) but at least there are some sources
from the demo available (for example my bss-bombing 3d routines *hehe* and my 
mini-shoot-em-up in the lower border of the greetings screen).

have fun
