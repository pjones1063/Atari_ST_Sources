
                   Notes for GemDemo v0.5Beta

- Bug regarding the iconfying of Demo windows fixed. This bug caused 
  the window to sometimes to get wrong width/height.

- You can now disable/enable all the variables in the Statics window. 
  This will help somewhat on framerate with slower machines.

- The key-combo to zero the fps counter have been moved from ctrl+z 
  to ctrl+r. This because pressing ctrl+z under mint stops the 
  application. Not exactly what we want :)

- Added 32K Motorola format gfx support.
