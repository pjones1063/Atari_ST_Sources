                                                             
AT THE END, THINGS SEEM TO BE SO RELATIVE.....    FOR YOU 
CAN USE THE FUNCTION KEYS OR SPACE TO CONTROL LIFE IN THIS ARTIFICIAL 
ENVIRONMENT.    ALTHOUGH OBVIOUS, IT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO THE STRUGGLE 
SURVIVING IN A JUNGLE, WHICH IS BEYOND THE COSY BEDROOM YOU ARE NOW IN...
                                                                         
                
OH, THE SAD FACTS OF LIFE...        WHY HAVE I URGED MYSELF TO CREATE THIS 
VIRTUAL WORLD SO DIFFERENT FROM THE REAL?      NO...    NOT DIFFERENT...   
MORE LIKE A MIRROR IMAGE.  NOT REAL, BUT A REFLECTION OF AN ENTITY.                 
                      ALL THOSE DIMENSIONS LOST...  ONLY A FEW REMAIN, FOR YOU... 
FOR WHOM I HAVE CRAFTED THIS MIRROR...                                      
                            
AN ORDINARY DAY STARTED LIKE THIS:             
A HEARTBEAT...     WARMTH...     A CAT STRETCHING TO WAKE UP...     
                  HE FEELS THE NEED 
TO STAY IN BED.  NO, HE CAN'T DO THAT.  HE MUST BE AWAKE.  AWAKE TO GATHER 
MORE INFORMATION.  YEAH, THAT'S IT.  WAKE UP.  AND LIVE...
                                                     
WALKING DOWNSTAIRS...  DOWN...  THE NEWSPAPER ALREADY THERE TO FEED HIM... 
                              
WITH THE NEWSPAPER IN FRONT OF HIM, HE 
BROWSED THROUGH SOME HEADLINES, AND FOUND ONE THAT PUZZLED HIM.
                                     
'A SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION OF LAMERS. BY  PROF.DR.IR. N.CAREBEAR'              
'THE MODERN LAMER CAN, WITH A CERTAINTY OF 98 PERCENT, AT BEST BE CLASSIFIED BY 
HIS PHYSICAL PARAMETERS.  ALTHOUGH SOME TESTS PROVE OTHERWISE, THESE 'TESTS' 
TEND TO HIGHLIGHT THE FIVE OR SIX ASPECTS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORDINARY CODER 
NEXT DOOR'.        WHAT'S THIS?, HE THOUGHT, AREN'T WE ALL CODERS THEN?        
SURELY THIS CAN'T BE TRUE!  HE QUICKLY WENT ON READING IN SOME DISMAY...   
'ASPECTS SUCH AS MATING, LOVING, AND HAVING RELATIONSHIPS CAN'T BE CONSIDERED 
AS EVIDENCE. IT'S LIKE COMPARING BANANAS WITH COMPUTERS. THEY DON'T LOOK ALIKE. 
THEY NEVER WILL, AND THEREFORE A PHYSICAL APPROACH TO THIS MATTER IS MUCH MORE CONVENIENT'.
   'FOR EXAMPLE, THE SIZE OF THEIR FOREHEAD IS MUCH GREATER THEN - '
      HE STOPPED READING...    HAD HE NOT SEEN A CODER WHO HAD THIS SAME HUGE FOREHEAD LATELY?       
              
G-OSH! IS THAT WHAT LAMERS LOOK LIKE?   THE MORE HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE IDEA, THE MORE HIS 
BODY STARTED TO SHIVER, MAKING HIM FEEL REALLY SICK...                
           TAKING HIS COAT. CLOSING THE FRONT DOOR. HE WENT OUTSIDE...
                                                                       
SUNSHINE WAS VERY BRIGHT ON HIS SIDE OF THE ROAD...                CARS 
PROJECTING COLD BLACK SHADOWS MADE HIM FEEL PLEASANT ENOUGH TO WALK 
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD...                                  
AHH...  THAT WAS IT...  THE SHADOWS CONVERTED HIM INTO THE COMPLETE 
NOTHINGNESS HE WAS...                                                                        
                    



HIS DIGITAL CLOCK TOLD HIM IT WAS TIME TO INCREASE HIS VELOCITY IF HE WANTED TO 
OBTAIN HIS RECORD OF BEING 
ON THE RIGHT LOCATION WITHIN THE TIME ALLOWED.          LEFT... RIGHT... 
LEFT... RIGHT... LEFT.. RIGHT.. LEFT. RIGHT.     THIS SIGHT OF A PERIODIC MOTION PLEASED HIM, 
AND HE BECAME SOMEWHAT OBSESSED BY THE IDEA THAT HE, HIMSELF, WAS A COMPUTER TICKING 
AWAY CLOCKCYCLES WITH HIS LEFT AND RIGHT SNEAKERS...  
                                                  
NOT AWARE OF A VEHICLE...   MISSING HIM BY AN INCH...    THE CAR PENETRATED DEAD CALM 
WATER, AFTER MAKING TWO FULL LOOPINGS...                           
AS THE CAR SANK, HE WAS FASCINATED BY THE STRANGE WHIRLPOOLS IT MADE...                       SUDDENLY HE BECAME AWARE OF HIS 
OWN MIRROR-IMAGE FADING AND WHIRLING INTO EXISTENCE...              HIS HEAD WAS TAKING 
SHAPE IN THE WATER...           68XXX DAMN!  HE TOO HAD THIS HUGE FOREHEAD!            THEN HE WAS N-OT A CODER!    
HE WAS A LAMER!                   AND THUS IT WAS TIME TO ACT!    
THE PEOPLE IN THE CAR COULD HAVE BEEN DROWNED ALREADY!  HE HAD TO DIVE! AND RESCUE THEM!    ...AND  ...AND...?       
   
HE COULD NOT DIVE, BECAUSE IT WAS WELL KNOWN CODERS COULD NOT SWIM!!                   
AND SO THE NEW BORN LAMER SAT DOWN...  WAITING ON THE AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE...                              

END OF STORY... (I HAD TO CUT IT SHORT).         
                      
HIT UNDO TO QUIT THIS.                                                       
NOW I'LL SAY SOMETHING PERSONAL ABOUT THE MAKING OF THIS DEMO.                         
THIS DEMO IS DEDICATED TO ZIGGY STARDUST AND CO. ,  FOR HE AND HIS FELLOW 
CODERS MADE ME GASP WHEN THEY SHOWED ME THE RELEASE OF THEIR 3D-DEMO, WAY BACK, 
AT THE CHRISTMAS CONVENTION IN HOLLAND...               AS YOU CAN SEE, THE SCREEN YOU ARE NOW IN 
HAS AN OBJECT THAT HAS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE RESET SCREEN OF ZIGGY.                             
AND NOW, AFTER 2.5 YEARS, I STILL THINK ZIGGY'S SCREENS ARE THE BEST AROUND.               
I HOPE I CAN PLEASE YOU, ZIGGY STARDUST(OVR), WITH MY PRODUCTION...                    
I FURTHERMORE WISH TO THANK BAT FOR HIS GREAT CHIP-MUSIC PLAYER, BECAUSE 
IF YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT THAT DAMN FAST, YOU GUYS OUT THERE WOULD HAVE HEARD 
SOME ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MUSIC!               AS FOR THE GRAPHICS PART, ZANAC DID A GREAT DESSERT, 
AND MADE THAT BLACK FONT LOOK ABSOLUTELY 'BLACK' ON THAT WHITE BACKGROUND!...                    
AND OFCOURSE SCAVENGER.  YOU MADE THIS SCREEN 150 PERCENT MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN IT 
ALREADY WAS (HUM!) WITH YOUR GREAT MUSIC. (AND I KNOW IT'S HARD TO MAKE A 
27 MINUTE SONG!).                           ALTHOUGH EVERY CODE-LINE IS TYPED IN BY MYSELF, I COULD NOT HAVE 
DONE IT WITHOUT YOU GUYS, GIVING ME INSPIRATON WITH NEW APPROACHES TO A NEW WAY OF DOING 
POLYGONS FAST... (AND EVEN MAKE 'ART' WHERE POSSIBLE).                   
NOW A SUM UP OF ALL THE IMPORTANT TECHNICAL AND EMOTIONAL FACTS... (SOB SOB!)               
        
1) TIME:  1.7 YEARS OF WORK. (MAINLY DUE TO THE NEVERENDING DEADLINE (LIVE BABY, LIVE!)).      
             
2) HARDWARE:  1 BROKEN DISKDRIVE (I HAVE NO HARDDISK). TWO LOST SCART CABLES.           
            
3) SOFTWARE: TURBO-ASS (PFRWWT!). APROX. 17000 ASSEMBLY LINES (WITH COMMENTS!). 
              
4) THE FAST POLYGONS:  REALTIME DELTA ROUTINES(TM)!!! (NOT VERY USABLE IN VECTOR GAMES!).    
                
5) THE FAST CALCULATIONS:  REALTIME CALCULATIONS BUFFERING(TM)!! (ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T BUFFER 27 MINUTES OF FRAME DATA!).
                
6) WHY?  I GOT THE IDEA ABOUT 2.2 YEARS AGO, AND CODED THE HARD ROUTINES IN TWO MONTHS, AND SAW IT WORK. 
ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT THAT FAST AS IT IS NOW, I KNEW THIS WAS THE WAY TO DO FAST POLYS...   
(THOUGH I REGRET THAT I URGED MYSELF TO CODE THE FASTER METHOD!!)...  
SO I MAINLY CODED IT TO LET OTHERS SEE THAT IT COULD BE DONE, FAST... (YOU SHOW OFF BASTARD I AM!) 
                  
7) EXP(LOG(X)+LOG(Y)) EQUALS X.Y  LOG(0) EQUALS OO  LOG(-X) EQUALS OO   EXP(LOG(X)-LOG(Y)) EQUALS X/Y   (WHAT'S THIS?  A MATH CLASS?  GET REAL/IMAGINARY!!)
                   
8) MEMORY:  MINE IS BAD (I LOST MY SCART CABLES BY FORGETTING WHERE I LEFT THEM).  A TOTAL OF 850-KILOBYTES OF POLYGON CODE... 
                       
9) OTHERS:  SOME OBJECT DESIGNS BY ZANAC, BAT, SCAVENGER, MANDROME...             
      
10) ME: I DID ALL THE TRACK DESIGNS, AND DESIGNED MOST OF THE OBJECTS.   
                
11) BLA BLA BLA   WHAT IS THAT GUY BLABBING ABOUT??? CAN'T HE SAY SOMETHING FUNNY? 
            
12) HUMOR:    I DID SOME HARD THINKING ON THE TEXTS...    
I I ME ME MY MY RAPIDO RAPIDO RAP RAP RAPHIIIIDOOOO !!!!!
