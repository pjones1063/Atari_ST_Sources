
                 3D GRAPHICS PROGRAMMING - PART 1


     To go with the first part of our 3D Graphics series, here is 
a list of the files included in the 3DGRAPH folder on the 
CoverDisk.

   3D_01.PRG   The assembled version of the program, if you don't 
               want to assemble it yourself. 

   3D_01.S     The main program code. This is the one that should 
               be assembled, and it includes all the other parts.          

   CORE_00.S   All the subroutines.

   SYSTM_01.S  All the System routines.

   DATA_00.S   The A Line data.

   BSS_00.S    The program variables.


                       ASSEMBLING THE FILES

     To assemble the files on this months disk, follow these simple 
setps:

     1. Format a new, blank disk.

     2. Copy GENST.PRG and GENST.RSC from the HISOFT folder onto 
     the root directory of the new disk.

     3. Copy all the files from the 3DGRAPH folder to the root 
     directory of the new disk. (These files will also be used in 
     other parts of the 3D Graphics series). You do not need to 
     copy the 3D_01.PRG, as this will be created by assembling the 
     other files.

     4. Load the assembler by double clicking on GENST.PRG

     5. Select LOAD... from the file menu and use the file selctor 
     to load 3D_01.S

     6. Select ASSEMBLE from the OPTIONS menu and assemble it as a 
     binary file with the name 3D_01.PRG.

     7. Exit the Assembler

     8. Double click on the 3D_01.PRG icon to run the program.
     
     9. To terminate the program, switch off your machine for 
     about ten seconds to clear the memory.
