          THE FINAL FRONTIER

The files included on this month's 
disk accompany the final installment 
of the 3D Graphics series which was 
printed last month.

Those of you who have purchased the 
book RealTime 3D Graphics by Andrew 
Tyler, on which this series is based, 
may have noticed that the routine  
SYSTM_04.S is absent from the book. 
This routine is included here as part 
of the series.

If you produce some outstanding 
animation using the routines from the 
series, why not send it in to ST User 
for inclusion on the cover disk?
