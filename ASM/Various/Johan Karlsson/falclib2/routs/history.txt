			History
			
			
v2	This one has got a file that is necessary to use DSPMOD and a file
	that is necessary to use TRIG included, unfortunately I forgot
	them in v1. A new function in WINDOW, @loadrsrc loads a resource file
	and creates a window with the loaded object in it.
			
v1	The first one. Lots of files missing.
