The fix for the 'write protect' bug on the STE for the old ST NEWS
issues (volumes 2,3 and 4).

Two files:

STE.S   the GenST 2.09 source
STE.TOS ready to run executable

The program installs a little piece of code in vector $28 that finds
the address peeked by ST NEWS and changes it into the right address
for the STE. Run it before you run ST NEWS.
