STEPal - STE Palette Editor v1.0

Copyright c.1991 Adam Greenwood

1.   Introduction.

STEPal  is  a  multiple palette editor for the  Atari  STE  which 
allows the full range of 4096 colours on this machine to be used. 
STEPal runs as a deskstop accessory,  and so can be used from any 
art package with a standard GEM menu bar. In addition, STEPal has 
a  'hold'  option  which  ensures that  the  correct  palette  is 
displayed,  even if the application restores its own palette,  as 
often happens.

For  those who are are short of memory,  Mini STEPal is a  single 
palette editor with less features,  but which takes up only  half 
the memory that STEPal uses.

STEPal  is designed to work in low resolution,  but will  run  in 
medium resolution, with only 4 editable colours.

To  run  STEPal the machine must be booted  with  STEPAL.ACC  and 
STEPAL.RSC on the boot dsic, outside any folders. If the resource 
file  is not present,  STEPal will not be installed and an  alert 
will appear to indicate this.  Once the machine has booted STEPal 
is  installed and can be accessed from under the 'Desk' title  of 
any GEM menu.

2.   The Main Dialog.

When STEPal is selected a dialog box will appear showing two rows 
of  selectable boxes for palette and colour selection,  a  colour 
edit box, and six buttons.

2.1  Palette Selection.

The  top  row  of six numbered boxes are used to  select  one  of 
STEPal's 16 palettes for editing or use.  The palette selected is 
shown  in reverse video.  Palettes can be copied by dragging  one 
palette box over another,  and the box copied to will briefly  be 
shown in reverse video to indicate a successful copy. The current 
palette  is always used when exiting from  STEPal,  and  whenever 
STEPal  is selected the machines palette is copied into  STEPal's 
current palette.

2.2  Colour selection.

Any of the 16 colours in each palette can be selected for editing 
using  the  row  of colour selection boxes  beneath  the  palette 
boxes. These are arranged in the order used by the machine at the 
lowest level, which is not the same order used by GEM, but is the 
order used by most art packages. The colour selectors work in the 
same  way  as the palette selectors,  and the current  colour  is 
always displayed in the colour edit box.

2.3  The  Colour Edit Box.

The  colour edit box shows the red green and blue  components  of 
each colour using three horizontal bars and numerically, plus the 
colour number,  and a colour box which shows the current  colour. 
The  three colour bars can be used to change the red,  green  and 
blue  components  of the current colour by  either  clicking  the 
arrows at each end of the bar, clicking on the bar on either side 
of the slider or by dragging the slider to the correct  position. 
The  reset button in the colour edit box will restore the  colour 
to  the  state  it was in when it was  selected  as  the  current 
colour.

3.   The Hold button. 

The  hold  button  is used to tell STEPal  whether  to  hold  the 
current palette after leaving STEPal.  If it is selected,  STEPal 
will  restore  its own palette every 1/50th  of  a  second,  thus 
ensuring  that STEPal's palette is always displayed.  This  makes 
any  colours stored in an art package or other  program  invalid, 
for instance the colours saved by an art package will not be  the 
colours as displayed. If hold is used the palette should be saved 
seperately  either  with  the picture in a DEGAS  file  or  in  a 
seperate file.

4.   The Options Button.

Clicking  the options button will display a new dialog  box  with 
several palette options:

4.1  Reset palette.

This  option will reset the current palette to the value  it  had 
when last selected.

4.2  Restore Palette.

This  will  restore  the current palette to  the  values  of  the 
current palette when STEPal was selected.

4.3  Restore All.

This  will restore all the palettes to the single palette in  use 
when STEPal was selected  - they will all be restored to the  one 
palette,  not to their individual values.  This can be useful for 
copying one palette into all the other palettes.

4.4  Disable/Enable.

The disable option allows a palette to be be disabled so that  it 
can be edited but will not be used for the screen  display.  This 
is  essential if a palette is being edited where  the  foreground 
and background colours are the same, otherwise the screen display 
will  be  unreadable.  If the current palette  is  disabled  this 
button allows it to be re-enabled.  Care must be taken when using 
palettes which could render the display unreadable.

5.   The File Button.

Clicking the file button will display STEPals file options. These 
allow  a  single palette to be loaded from or saved to  either  a 
palette file or an existing DEGAS picture.  All sixteen  palettes 
can  also  be  loaded from and saved to  a  single  file.  STEPal 
defaults  to the extensions .PAL for palette files and  .ALP  for 
multiple palette files.

6.   The Fade Button.

The  fade button allows a gradually darkening series of  palettes 
to  be run through to check whether they work as a  'fade'.  This 
can be done at 25 or 50 Hz,  and is useful when designing 'fades' 
for programs or slideshows. Fade will run through the palettes in 
either direction, from 0-15 or 15-0, or both.

7.   Exiting STEPal.

There  are  two ways to leave STEPal,  with either  the  Okay  or 
Cancel buttons.  Okay will exit with the current palette,  whilst 
Cancel will restore the palette in use when STEPal was selected.

8.   Mini STEPal.

     Mini STEPal is a single palette version of  STEPal,  without 
the fade and options dialogs, and is useful where memory is short 
or where there is not enough memory for both the art package  and 
STEPal.  To  use  Mini  STEPal  use  the  files  MSTEPAL.ACC  and 
MSTEPAL.RSC as for STEPal.
