1.   Introduction

STEPlay  is  an 8-bit sample player and editor designed  to  make 
full  use of the STE's DMA sound chip.  Samples can be played  at 
any  of the STE's four playback frequencies and as either  stereo 
or  mono.  The  frequency  of a sample can  be  halved  to  allow 
playback at a lower frequency,  and a stereo sample can be  built 
up  from two mono samples.  Samples can also be shifted to  allow 
the  use  of  samples saved in two's complement  format  such  as 
Replay samples.  STEPlay also allows sample compression for  both 
stereo and mono samples,  with the best results achieved with the 
higher frequency samples. Depending on the actual sample, samples 
at  50 kHz can be compressed to up half the original size of  the 
sample.  Purer  sounds compress better than more distorted  ones, 
for  instance a musical note will compress better than a  gunshot 
sound. In extreme cases the sample may not compress at all.

To  run STEPlay you need STEPLAY.PRG and STEPLAY.RSC in the  same 
folder  on your disk.  Simply double click  on  STEPLAY.PRG,  the 
program will load and the main menu will appear.

2.   The Main Menu.

STEPlay  uses  a standard GEM menu bar similar to that  found  in 
most GEM-based applications.  All operations and settings can  be 
accessed from this menu. Apart from the Desk title, which has any 
desk  accessories and the 'About STEPlay' item which  displays  a 
small dialog box, there are three menu titles. These provide File 
facilities, playback control and sample editing operations.

2.1  The File Menu.

The file menu contains all file operations, plus the quit option. 
All  file  operations use the standard file  selector,  with  TOS 
1.4/1.6 enhancements.  Samples can be loaded and saved,  and  can 
also  be loaded into either channel of a stereo  sample.  STEPlay 
works  with two types of file,  standard sample files  containing 
only  sample data and STEPlay files which save  some  information 
about playback frequency, compression and stereo/mono format with 
the sample.

STEPlay  defaults to the file extension .STE for  STEPlay  files, 
and  makes no distinction between stereo,  compressed etc in  the 
file extension. The program will automatically select the correct 
settings for frequency and stereo/mono when a file is loaded, but 
the user must select them from the menu if a non-STEPlay file  is 
read.

When the sample is ready for use in a program it is usually  best 
to  write the sample as a non-STEPlay file,  thus giving  a  file 
with only sample data.

The file menu items have the following functions:

2.1.1     Compress

Compress  can  either be selected  or  de-selected,  and  appears 
checked  (ticked in English) when compression is  selected.  When 
compress  is  selected  STEPlay will save all  files  in  STEPlay 
compressed  format.   Since  loading  automatically  decompresses 
samples  if necessary compress does not affect the load and  load 
half operations, which can load either format. If the compression 
ratio  for a sample is particularly low,  ie the sample does  not 
compress very well,  compression may fail, in which case an alert 
will be displayed and the file will not be written. In some cases 
the  original  sample will be unaffected,  but often it  will  be 
corrupted (in memory, not on disc) if compression fails.

2.1.2     Read

Read  is  used to import a non-STEPlay file  into  STEPlay.  This 
allows sample files from sound sampling packages to to be  loaded 
into  memory to be converted into STE format,  halved down  to  a 
different frequency, split into stereo or to be played. This also 
allows  STEPlay's  compressed format to be used  for  any  sample 
files.

2.1.3     Write

Write  is  used  to  save a sample to  disc  without  any  format 
information  and without the option of compression.  This can  be 
used either to return a sample to some other sampling software or 
to use it for your own programs.

2.1.4     Load

The load command is used to load any complete sample into  memory 
ready  for  editing or playback.  If there is enough  memory  the 
whole  sample  will be loaded,  otherwise an alert  box  will  be 
displayed  with  the option of either truncating  the  sample  or 
cancelling the load.  Note that since compressed files may not be 
proportional  to  the actual sample compressed  files  cannot  be 
truncated.If  truncate is selected as much of the sample as  will 
fit in memory will be loaded. If cancel is selected the load will 
be  aborted.  Load  will load any frequency  of  sample,  of  any 
format, either stereo or mono, and compressed if the decompressed 
sample  will  fit.  Samples  are  automatically  decompressed  on 
loading, and the correct settings selected.

2.1.5     Load Half.

The  load half operation is used to load a complete  mono  sample 
into  either the left or right channel of a stereo  sample.  This 
can  be either a sample previously loaded and made  stereo  using 
split  (see  below),  or a sample already loaded into  the  other 
channel  using load half.  If the sample to be loaded is  smaller 
than the existing sample it will be padded with zeroes  (silence) 
up  to the end of the existing sample.  If it is larger than  the 
existing  sample then the existing channel will be padded  up  to 
the  end  of the new sample.  If there is not enough  memory  the 
sample  can  be  truncated  to  fit,  provided  that  it  is  not 
compressed,  as for load.  An alert box is used to select left or 
right channel.

Some  excellent  effects  can be created by  combining  two  mono 
samples  into one stereo one,  but remeber that a  stereo  sample 
takes up twice the memory and disk space as a mono one.


2.1.6     Save.
     
Save  is  used  to save a complete sample  of  any  frequency  or 
format,  either stereo or mono. If there is not enough disk space 
an alert box will be displayed showing this, and the save will be 
aborted.  Remeber, sound samples are notorious for eating up disk 
space,  so  it is always useful to have a spare  formatted  blank 
disc  handy.  Save will the save the sample in STEPlay format  so 
that it can be loaded with all the settings correct.  If compress 
is  selected (ticked) then the file will be saved  in  compressed 
format.

2.1.7     Quit.

When  quit is selected an alert box is displayed to  confirm  the 
choice.  If  it is confirmed the program will return the user  to 
the desktop.

2.2       The Play Menu.

The  play menu is used to control the playback of the  sample  in 
memory.  Any  of  the  STE's four  playback  frequencies  can  be 
selected,  either mono or stereo,  and playback can be looped  so 
that the sample repeats.  The stop facility stops a sample at any 
time, and is particularly useful when using loop.

2.2.1     Playback Frequency.

The STE has four playback frequencies,  these are 6.25 KHz,  12.5 
KHz,  25 KHz and 50 KHz.  These are shown as the first four items 
under the play menu.  The current frequency is shown with a check 
mark to the left.  To change the playback frequency, simply click 
the  frequency required on the menu and it will be used  for  any 
future  playback.  Changing  the frequency will  not  affect  the 
playback  of any sample currently being played.  When  a  STEPlay 
sample is loaded the correct playback frequency is  automatically 
selected.

2.2.2     Stero and Mono.

The next two items under the play menu select whether a sample is 
played  as  a stereo or mono sample.  Samples  should  always  be 
played  in  the correct mode,  ie try to avoid playing  a  stereo 
sample as a mono sample and vice versa.  Selecting stereo or mono 
is simply a matter of clicking the correct entry on the menu, the 
current selection again being shown checked.

Any operation which creates a stereo sample from a mono one  will 
automatically  select stereo mode,  and loading a STEPlay  sample 
automatically selects stereo or mono for that sample.

2.2.3     Play, Loop and Stop.

The  Play  operation plays the current sample  at  the  frequency 
currently  selected  in  whichever  mode,   stereo  or  mono,  is 
currently selected.  If Loop has been selected,  in which case it 
will be checked,  then the sample will be repeated until stopped. 
If loop is not selected the sample will play only once.  Stop can 
be  used  to stop playback of a single or looped  sample  at  any 
time.

2.3       The Sample Menu.

The  sample  menu has all the commands for changing  and  editing 
samples.  Samples can be halved to change the frequency,  shifted 
to convert them to or from the two's complement format, and split 
into a stereo sample.

2.3.1     Shift

Shift  is  used  to  convert the  sample  in  memory  from  two's 
complement  format as used by Replay 4 to the  STE's  format,  or 
back if necessary. It is easy to tell if a sample is in the wrong 
format as it will sound too loud and very distrorted when  played 
back. STE samples should not be in two's complement format - many 
samplers use a format the same as the STE's,  but these often  do 
not have compatible frequencies.  More samplers are now  becoming 
available which are STE compatible in some way.

2.3.2     Half

The  half  operation halves the size of the sample in  memory  by 
removing every other value from the sample.  This has the  effect 
of halving the playback frequency for that sample,  but with  the 
associated loss of quality. Some samplers only have one frequency 
which coincides with one of the STE's,  and often this is 50 KHz, 
as with Replay 4.  Some don't have any compatible frequencies, so 
if you are buying a sampler to use with an STE check first.  With 
a  50 KHz sample,  in order to get smaller samples which  can  be 
replayed at the lower frequencies it is necessary to half such  a 
sample as many times as necessary, for instance to get a 12.5 KHz 
sample  from a 50 KHz sample it would need to be halved  once  to 
get  25  KHz  and then again to get 12.5.  There  is  no  way  of 
'doubling'  a sample once it has been halved.  Halving  a  sample 
automatically  reduces  playback  frequency to  the  next  lowest 
setting.

2.3.3     Split.
    
The Split operation is used to split the mono sample in memory so 
that it forms one channel of a stereo sample,  the other  channel 
being empty.  This will double the length of the sample,  and  if 
the  double  size will not fit in memory the user  is  given  the 
option  of either truncating the sample or cancelling  the  split 
operation.  An alert box is used to select which channel the mono 
sample will become when split.

Loading a mono sample and then splitting it is quicker than using 
load half for the first channel, but once a sample has been split 
load half must be used to load a sample into the other channel.
