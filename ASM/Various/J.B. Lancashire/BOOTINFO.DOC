                             BOOTINFO


    Bootinfo is a simple desk accessory written by J.B. Lancashire that will
help you identify different disk formats. To use it you must copy the file
BOOTINFO.ACC to the root directory of the disk you boot up with. Next time you
switch on or press the reset button the utility will automatically be loaded
and installed.

    On selecting the Bootinfo accessory on the Desk menu the BIOS parameter
block of the disk in drive A will be read and displayed in a dialog box.
Selecting the Info button will enable you to look at another disk, and clicking
on Exit will return you to the desktop or the program running when you called
Bootinfo.

    The source code for Bootinfo - it's written in 68000 machine code -
demonstrates how desk accesories and dialog boxes can be accessed from assembly
language.
