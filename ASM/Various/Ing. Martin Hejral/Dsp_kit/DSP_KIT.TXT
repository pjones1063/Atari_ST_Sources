*  DSP 56001 KIT for Falcon  *
******************************

If you need to write a program which uses the DSP 56001 on FALCON 
computers, if you need to set the matrix & load DSP files - you need 
the DSP KIT from Martin Hejral.

If you don't know

    - how you can configure the matrix to do the folowing;
      a) ADC -> DSP -> DAC
           (i.e. Add a DSP effect to sound going from the mic input to 
           the headphone output)
      b) DMAplay -> DSP -> DAC
           (i.e. Add a DSP effect to a sample file being played back)
      c) ADC -> DSP -> DMArecord
           (i.e. Add a DSP effect whilst recording a sound file)

    - how you can load .LOD files?

- you shoud quickly get the DSP KIT.

There are completed and tested sources, which are very preliminary 
version of my DSP KIT (no english docs now, only czech sorry). Use 
MIXER.ASM as frame for your DSP programs and its communication with 
68030. C sources were compiled on PURE C system (see PRJ file).

Succesfull programming of Falcon DSP
                                       Martin

HISTORY:
********
version
0.0 - 1995 - first released, basic settings of sound system, loading 
      of DSP programm, basic frame of DSP 56001 program, communication 
      DSP <-> 68030 via HOST INTERFACE and SSI (only synchronous mode 
      now)
0.1 - 22.Mai.1996 - added oscilloscope drawing routine, added slider 
      regulator routines, trying send the data from DSP direct to 
      screen using SSI
