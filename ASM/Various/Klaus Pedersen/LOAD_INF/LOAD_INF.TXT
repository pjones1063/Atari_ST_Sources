You should check that you have the following files in the NT_COMP
directory:
   LOAD_INF\
      LOAD_INF.PRG         ; THE program
      DOCS\                ;
         LOAD_INF.TXT      ; This document.
         SOURCE\           ; The source to the LOAD_INF.PRG
            TINYSTRT.S     ; The Startup code.
            LOAD_INF.C     ; The program source.


   The first thing I realised, after I got my harddisc was that
the desktop should have a way to load a new 'desktop.inf', because
every program have it's own natural desktop.    When you are programming you 
need to have an open window for the source, one for the RCS, and one for the 
compiler. And the compiler has to be installed to take '.C' and '.S' files.
   But when you are writing letters, you may want to have an open window for 
the DOC or WUP files, for the word processor and for the drawing program. Here 
you may want to have WORDUP taking '.WUP' files, and the drawing package taking 
'.IMG' files...
   This program alows a new 'desktop.inf' to be loaded. The 'desktop.inf' file 
tells the DESKTOP where windows should be opened, which files the programs are 
installed to take, drive and trash-can
names, and all the information that can be set with the CONTROL
accessory.
   The program can be used in two ways :
         o double click on the program 'load_inf.prg', and a file
           selector will show up, where you can select the '.inf'         
           file, that you want to use...      
         o or if you install 'load_inf.prg' to take '.inf' files, then 
           when double-clicking on a '.inf' file it will be loaded.

   I have made a default desktop with one open window that shows all
my '.inf' files. I have put them in a directory called C:\DESKTOP\.
With a double-click on one of them I have a desktop tuned for that
application.
Ok, here is what you can do:
   1. make a directory called "DESKTOP"
   2. copy 'load_inf.prg' into this dir.
   3. now copy the old 'desktop.inf' into this dir      and rename the file to 
'empty.inf' or something.
   4. now with the 'desktop' directory open, select      'load_inf.prg', choose 
menu "install application...",      now type "INF" and press "OK".
   5. now save the desktop, and copy the new 'desktop.inf'      into the 
'desktop' directory...
   With the original 'desktop.inf' in the 'desktop' directory, you can now save 
a new 'desktop.inf' without loosing all the work.
   Now set up the desktop as you prefer. Open the windows and install the 
program, to take files. Next:
   6. save the desktop, and
   7. copy the new 'desktop.inf' from the boot drive,       into the 'desktop' 
directory, that file allready
      exists, give the new 'desktop.inf' a new name,
      and press ok/overwrite.
   8. now copy the old 'desktop.inf' from the 'desktop'      directory, onto 
the boot drive, and over-write...
phew, that just about covers the process of installing the program, and saving 
a new desktop.

_IMPORTANT_NOTE_
If you have TOS1.0 or TOS1.2 then read on...
   [  If you have a Atari STE, or TOS1.4 fitted (a '89 in the  ]
   [  (c) message in 'About the Desktop'), then you don't have ]
   [  to bother with this section.                             ]
   -The 'desktop.inf' file can only be 1024 bytes, (in TOS1.4 and
TOS 1.6 it can be 4192 bytes long). This can be a serious limit if
you have installed lots of programs.
   -When you have installed a program, the path to the program is missing. If 
you have 'load_inf.prg' in the same directory, as the '.inf' files, then just 
remember that there is a problem and read on. But if you have '.inf' all over 
the harddisc (fx to get back to the initial desktop), you have the problem...
   To fix it, then read the 'desktop.inf' into your favourite texteditor or 
wordprocessor and find a line looking like this :
         #G 03 04   LOAD_INF.PRG@ *.INF@ And to the program name add the full 
path, like here, where 'load_inf.prg' is in directory 'C:\DESKTOP\' :
         #G 03 04   C:\DESKTOP\LOAD_INF.PRG@ *.INF@ You also have to do this 
for every other program that you install to take files...

THE SOURCE CODE:
   The startup code, supplied here is for TOS programmers like me, who don't 
care much about <stdio>. If you only use the TOS and GEM libs then this startup 
code is for you. If you don't use Turbo_C then remember to pass argc and argv 
on the stack when calling main...
   In 'load_inf.c' there is a small fileselector, that works in all TOS 
versions (with Label option on new TOSses), this should interest some source 
hunters :-)
Happy Hacking...
