   MAKESORT - Create character sort table for NKCC

   The utility produces the table used for the NKM_HUMAN option in function
   nkc_strcmp().

   Usage: makesort input_file output_file

          input_file  = Input of MAKESORT; the sort order file (see below)

          output_file = Output of MAKESORT; a piece of assembly language source
                        code including the symbol <sorttab> and the data
                        associated to this symbol (this table is used in NKCC.S)

                        <sorttab> is an array of unsigned bytes with 256
                        entries. It is used as a translation table, indexed
                        by the ASCII code of a character.


   The sort order file specifies the order of characters that shall be used
   for string comparism instead of the regular ASCII order (when the option
   flag NKM_HUMAN is set).

   Format of the sort order file:
   - 224 lines for the characters from $20 up to $ff
   - each line consists of a character plus CR and LF as line termination
   - each character must appear once in the file (MAKESORT checks this)
   - everything beyond the 224th line is ignored

   The control codes ($00...$1f) don't appear in the sort order file, so
   we have only 224 instead of 256 lines. Their entries in the created
   <sorttab> have the constant values $00...$1f.

   The file CMPORDER.TXT contains the character order used in the NKCC source
   code in this package.
