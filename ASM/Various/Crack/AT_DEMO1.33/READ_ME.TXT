Please note:

Copy the file "A_TRACK.PRG" and the WHOLE folder to your harddisk. 
You may copy both into ANOTHER folder, but don't copy the program 
file into the data folder!
The FULL-version only works, if the delivered KEY is in the 
ROM-port of your computer.

To use any function in AudioTracker there has to be installed at least
one AudioTracker Tape on the harddisk (Install Tape/Open Tape).

For using SCSI-drives you have to copy the file "SHDRIVER.SYS"
to drive C:, to get the best result (reboot your system).


If AudioTracker does not work correctly on your system, the reason
might be a software-expansion, that prevents the installation 
of the AudioTracker-Font.
In this case, you only have to rename or clear the file
"A_TRACK.FNT" which is in the folder "A_TRACK.DAT".
The program would have to work then correctly.
