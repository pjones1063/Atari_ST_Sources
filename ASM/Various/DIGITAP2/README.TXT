New features not described in the manual:

*	Tape drive shortcuts (on numeric key block):
    position to start         (
    fast rewind               -
    stop (recorder & edit)    *
    play (recorder & edit)    /
    fast forewind             +
    position to end           )

* Recomendation: use monochrome mode if you need the highest
  possible performance speed.

* Tape position remains the same if changing from
    recorder window (tape position) to
    edit window (cursor) and back.
  For acurate positioning (insert recording, etc.) use the
  edit window and then change to the recorder window.

* Former version tape files can be converted to the new virtual
  track format. Select 'open tape' and confirm if you want to
  convert the tape. Conversion back to the old format is not
  possible.
