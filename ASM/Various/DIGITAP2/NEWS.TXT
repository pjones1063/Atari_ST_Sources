     From now on, with DigiTape Version 1.03, free effect 
     modules are supported.
     This means, that everybody, who feels himself able of a 
     little C- and a little more DSP-assembly-code-programming 
     is able to set up modules with sound effects to be linked 
     to DigiTape.
     We supply developpers information about how to do the software
     interface and the connection to DigiTape. More information
     that is needed, you will find in the Motorola's Developpers
     Manual for DSP 56k and in the Falcons Developpers Toolkit
     from Atari.
