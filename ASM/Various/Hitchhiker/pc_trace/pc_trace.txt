        PC-TRACE  is a VERY small (about 1K) program that allows  you  to 
        find  out  where a machine code program is  currently  executing.  
        This  is achieved by displaying the PC (Program Counter)  in  the 
        top right corner of the screen.   With this ability you can get a 
        good idea where the program is,  and then examine it further with 
        a  debugger like MonST.   The PC display is updated every  screen 
        refresh,  so it is fairly accurate,  and only uses about 1-2%  of 
        the processors' time.
        
        Compatibility:
        
             Due  to  the  nature of this program,  it may  prove  to  be 
        incompatible  with a few programs,  MonST is one of  these.   The 
        display  routines  will  only  work in  the  standard  ST  screen 
        resolutions,  so you guys with Big Screens are out of  luck.   If 
        you run any programs that use the VBI by patching into $70,  then 
        this will probably disable PC-TRACE, but normal VBI routines that 
        use the _vblqueue should work correctly.
        
        PC-TRACE is in the Public Domain and may be distributed freely as 
        long  as the files  PC_TRACE.PRG,  PC_TRACE.S,  and  PC_TRACE.TXT 
        remain unchanged.
        
        
        Future enhancements:
        
             In  the near future a feature may be added to slow down  and 
        the   speed  up  the  ST  in  realtime  by  pressing  a   hot-key 
        combination.   If you want this new version then keep up to  date 
        with  future releases of the 'Hitchhiker's PD / Shareware  Disk',
