Some music progs have now been renamed with the v/b slot in which
they run.

Ex: clem_4de.prg runs in vertical blank slot $4de

Basic and 68000 programmers may either CHAIN these programs
or store them in an AUTO folder.

See example in the Budgie 'chain' folder.

AUTO folders may be used to store these tunes, but ONLY if the main
program following the tune, is ALSO in the AUTO folder.
Th problem is GEM, which gets initialised AFTER the music is running
and immediately proceeds to wipe the v/b slots, therefore causing 
bombs.  

To recap, these tunes must run AFTER GEM has been initialised, 
for instance by clicking on a CHAIN loader program,
or BEFORE GEM is initialised, and then making sure, it is kept OUT
completely.

The following
procedure should be used to turn the music ON/OFF from within
your own programs:

Say you choose a tune that runs in slot $4de


In assembler:
	move.l	$4de,$200	store interrupt vector in a safe place
	clr.l	$4de		turn off interrupt
	lea	$ff8800,a0	get sound chip 
	move.b	#7,(a0)
	move.b	#%11111111,2(a0) cut out lingering noise
	move.l #$8000000,$ff8800 
	move.l #$9000000,$ff8800 
	move.l #$a000000,$ff8800

to turn music on again:
	move.l	$200,$4de
Nothing could be simpler. 


Basic users may turn these tunes on/off in a similar manner by poking $4de
(or whatever slot is used). Make sure you are in supervisor mode.
STOS always runs in supervisor mode.
HiSoft and GFA users should check on this one.
Ex: to turn music off from a basic program:
	loke $200,leek($4de)   	store interrupt vector in a safe place
                   		$200 IS safe.  loke means 'poke a LONG word'
	loke $4de,0      	kill interrupt   (LONG word!)
	poke $ff8800,7   	BYTE size !!
	poke $ff8802,255 	BYTE size
	loke $ff8800,$8000000   LONG word
	loke $ff8800,$9000000
	loke $ff8800,$a000000

to retrieve music:
	loke $4de,leek($200)

There is no reason why several tunes cannot reside in different v/b slots
Of course, only one may be turned on at any one time.
If two tunes at say, $4d2 and $4de are allowed to run concurrently, 
the $4de one will have priority and will be heard loudest.
Eight v/b routine slots at checked every 1/50th sec by TOS and executed
unless they contain zero (long word).

Locations $200, $204, $208, $20c are FREE locations is
zero page. They may be used for temporary storage.
Addresses are LONG words, ie 4 bytes.
ex: MOVE.L $44e,$204 will store current screen address in $204

You will see that some tunes actually have a $204 or $208 body.
They may be loaded in the normal manner (chained or inside the
auto folder). The difference is that they will not play. They are
not yet activated. To activate them, just have a line inside
your program, that says : move.l $204,$4de  (or move $208,$4de)

In basic: loke $4de,leek($204) /long words.

The tunes in the Budgie collection are there courtesy of Gary (Goth)
Wheaton of The Shapeshifters. Please acknowledge if you use them.

Finally, try not to use tunes that have already appeared in previous
Budgie games.
