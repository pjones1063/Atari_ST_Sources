                         =========================

     This  is  a  little accessory for flipping the screen colours to black
background  and white text, resulting in less strain on your poor bloodshot
mince  pies!  and  a  lot  more  economical with available ram than Atari's
control panel. Install the accessory in the normal manner and then click on
from the desk menu, the screen colours will be flipped, click again and the
screen will be restored to the original palette settings.

     The  program will work in all three st screen resolutions and users of
medium  res  green  screen  monitors ( like yours truly ) will find it most
useful.  Unfortunately,  it  will  not  work  properly  on a ste due to the
expanded palette, sorry about this but as I am a victim of the recession, I
am  unable  to upgrade to a mega ste4!, I have however, included the source
code  for  you  to  have  a fiddle with, it should'nt take much fiddling to
alter the code to the ste's palette settings.

     Thanks  are  in order to Roger Pearson and the guys at zzSoft, without
the book " introducing ATARI ST machine code" I'd still be writing progs in
basic!. The program is public domain, please distribute.
