   canticle.prg & canticl2.prg

	     o-O-o

   Both run as vbls in slot 2.

 If included in an auto folder or
 'launched' from your program the
 tunes can be disabled by....
	
	 CLR.L $4CE+4 

 ; make silence

 ;waitvbl, then...

	move.l #$8000000,$ff8800 
	move.l #$9000000,$ff8800 
	move.l #$a000000,$ff8800 


 Obviously, if you wish to re-enable
 you must... 
	MOVE.L $4CE+4,TUNE 
 beforehand.

 and... 
	MOVE.L TUNE,$4CE+4
 to restart.

 If your prog installs a new vbl then
 non of the above will be relevent.

 The tunes can also be 'run' by....

 MOVE.L $4CE+4,A0

 and JSR (A0)  

 every 50th of a second. (no registers
 are saved by the tunes, so you must
 do this yourself, if required.)

All this for the benefit of....

	*-*-*-*-*
All those who seem not to know.

Those who want to know.

Those who don't want to know, but must

Those who think they know.

The Tommyknockers. (konig)

The Happenin' Boiz. (lpoke $4ce+4,0)

Those who face the dilemma.

 Them as knows, knows and them as
 thinks they knows, knows nowt.


 Keep on rockin' in the free world.
