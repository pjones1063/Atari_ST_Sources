My first 68k intro on AtariST.
Back in February, I started learning coding 68k on various platforms (Amiga or Atari basically) and was so excited that I made various dot or other effects.

I took one of these effects and tried to squish it to fit it in 256 bytes. At first it seemed like a big challenge but then I scrapped system init and other code.
I use vasm with -opt-size and somehow it was 220 bytes from 248 reported and the rest is header? I was expecting some even number. Wondering where the 1 byte left :)
