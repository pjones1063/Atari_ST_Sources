TapeBIOS driver software Version 1.5
====================================

	Well, Here it is. A TapeBIOS for the Atari ST and Atari TT computers,
as long as the DMA registers on the TT haven't moved since the ST days. The
TapeBIOS program allows these Atari machines to talk to a SCSI tape drive
connected through the DMA bus(not the SCSI bus of the TT).

	Provided in this package is quite a few extras. i.e. programmers docs,
support programs, to use and to be used as examples on how to access the 
capabilities of the TapeBIOS software. Also provided is the necessary include
files and library code for the GNU 'C' compiler, i.e. TAPEBIND.H in the include
directory contains the necessary bindings to include into your 'C' programs.

	The TapeBIOS software installs itself into the TRAP #10 vector, via the
XBRA protocol and gives itself and ID of 'TAPE'. TapeBIOS also installs itself
into the COOKIE JAR, again with an ID of 'TAPE', the value contained in the jar
is the current version number, which is v1.5. If no COOKIE JAR exists then
TapeBIOS will create one with space for 20 cookies, but if the jar is full
then TapeBIOS copies the old jar into a new one with space for 20 extra cookies
and then installs itself into this new jar leaving 19 cookies spare.

How do we install this wonderful software ?
===========================================

	Well, to install TapeBIOS a few rules must be first met. A file must
accompany TapeBIOS for it to function correctly and install properly. This 
file is TAPEBIOS.INF. This file currently contains just two numbers for 
TapeBIOS to operate. These values are the SCSI ID or address of your tape
streamer and a timeout value.

	The timeout value is a number between 0 and 65535, but must be entered
in the TAPEBIOS.INF file as a 5 digit number (e.g. for a timeout value of 10,
the number must be entered in TAPEBIOS.INF as 00010). The timeout is a small
delay before the next SCSI command is issued to the tape streamer. This is 
because some streamers take a small amount of time to execute a command and
return the appropriate values, but this does vary from vendor to vendor. Again,
check the DRIVES.TST file for more information.

	Check the example TAPEBIOS.INF file in the bios directory to help you
install TapeBIOS.

Testing TapeBIOS with your streamer
===================================

	If you find that you have a tape streamer not listed in DRIVES.TST,then
to make sure that TapeBIOS can talk to your tape drive, run the TAPETEST.TOS
program located in the test directory. If all goes well TapeBIOS will run 
through the complete test without problems, if it does please notify me that
your tape streamer works.

	If not, then the troubleshooting phase starts. If you are one of the
unlucky ones in which TapeBIOS cannot talk to your tape streamer then try
some of the following to remedy the problem.

	1. If the error is spuradic, i.e. different errors every time you
	   execute TAPETEST.TOS, then try increasing the timeout value. The 
	   best idea is to increase to a maximum then re-run TAPETEST.TOS.
	   If the problem still occurs try the number 2.

	2. If you have the GNU 'C' compiler then try removing the offending
	   command from TAPETEST.C and re-compile. Then re-run TAPETEST.TOS
	   and see how far the test gets, making note of commands removed
	   and any errors that appeared because of the offending command.

	Then, if all goes well and the test finishes, report back to me if
you think you have found a problem or to update me on any new information that
doesn't appear in the file DRIVES.TST. Your input is very valuable to helping
improve TapeBIOS.

DISCLAIMER: I cannot be held responsible for any data lost through the misuse
of using this package. Although I use this software every day and this setup
works well with my system. I would be happy to fix any problems found using
this software, but please do not flame me through misuse or loss of data using
the package.
