Magnetic Tape Utility (Support Section), MT.TTP
===============================================

	MT.TTP provides the ability to execute some basic commands on the 
tape drive. These are REWIND, RETENSION, ERASE, LOAD and UNLOAD tape.
The functions can be activated by typing the command request as a parameter
to MT.TTP.
	
	e.g.	mt.ttp erase 

	The above command will erase the whole tape currently situated in the
tape drive.

NOTE: Some of the commands used by MT.TTP are not supported by all streamers
and will fail if called. Please read the DRIVES.TST file for more details.
