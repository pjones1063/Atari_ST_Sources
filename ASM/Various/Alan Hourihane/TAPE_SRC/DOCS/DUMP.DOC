Dump Utility (Support Section), DUMP.TTP
========================================

	DUMP.TTP allows individual or multiple partitions to be dumped, i.e.
image backup, to tape. This form of backup is a lot faster than a selective
file backup provided by my own port of GNU tar v1.10, which incidentally
supports SCSI tape drives using the TapeBIOS function calls.

	DUMP.TTP takes arguments. These arguments are as follows:-

	e.g. dump.ttp [-a] [drivelist] [dumpname_a] [dumpname_b] [etc...]

	Example, to dump drives C: F: and G: with dumpname Boot for C:, Apps
for F: and General for G:, execute the following:-

	e.g. dump.ttp cfg Boot Apps General

	The '-a' option allows you to append to the end of an existing DUMP
tape.

NOTE: Be sure to have a tape in the drive that can handle the amount of data
to be transferred to it. Currently DUMP.TTP does not check for End-of-Media
and will not request another volume, so this will fail.
