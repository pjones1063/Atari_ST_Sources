Restore Utility (Support Section), RESTORE.TTP
==============================================

	RESTORE.TTP allows individual or multiple partitions to be dumped, i.e.
image restore, from tape. This form of restore is a lot faster than a selective
file restore provided by my own port of GNU tar v1.10, which incidentally
supports SCSI tape drives using the TapeBIOS function calls.

	RESTORE.TTP takes arguments. These arguments are as follows:-

	e.g. restore.ttp [drivelist] [dumpname_a] [dumpname_b] [etc...]

	RESTORE.TTP is capable of restoring data to different drives than what
the data was backed up too. Under these circumstances if a drive is selected
which is larger than the amount of data to restore, then the drive will be
reduced and all data will be restored. But, if a drive is selected which is
smaller than the amount of data to restore, then all data will not be restored
and could smash data on other partitions. USE THIS OPTION WITH CAUTION.

	e.g. restore.ttp de Boot Apps

	Will restore the Boot dumpname to partition D: and the Apps dumpname
to partition E: regardless of the original source drive.
