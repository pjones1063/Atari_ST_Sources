The -x option selects an XMODEM file transfer.
The -xc option selects checksum instead of CRC.
Examples:  -x forbush.txt   Download with XMODEM using CRC.
           -xc oldfile.txt  Download with XMODEM using checksum.

The -y option selects the YMODEM batch protocol.
Examples:  -y          Download YMODEM BATCH to the default folder
           -y c:\dd    Download YMODEM BATCH to the DD folder on drive C:

The -z option selects ZMODEM file transfer.
Examples:
           -z c:\download  Download ZMODEM to the DOWNLOAD folder on drive C:

The options -u -z select ZMODEM uploading.
Examples:  -u c:\uploads\*.*  Upload using ZMODEM every file.
           -u file1 file2     Upload using ZMODEM FILE1 and FILE2.

The options -u -y select YMODEM uploading.
Examples:  -u -y c:\ups\*.*   Send using YMODEM all the files.
           -u -y file1 file2  Send using YMODEM FILE1 and FILE2.

The options -u -x select XMODEM uploading.
Examples:  -u -x snowball.arc  Send using XMODEM the file SNOWBALL.ARC.
           -u -x1k ako.gif     Send using XMODEM-1K the file AKO.GIF

5.7.1  -a  Alarm
Normally, XYZ will ring the terminal bell when it has completed transferring
all the selected files.  Putting -a on the command line makes XYZ ring the
bell after each and every file.

5.7.2  -b  Baud rate
This does NOT set the baud rate of your modem port.  This sets the rate that
XYZ bases its transfer times on.  You only need to use this if you are using a
non-standard baud rate, like 14,400, or if XYZ cannot determine the correct
baud rate on your model of ST.  Setting a rate of 0 disables the transfer time
messages.  There must not be any spaces between the -b and the speed.
Example:  -b14400       Base transfer times on 14,400 baud
          -b0           Disable transfer time messages.

5.7.3  -h  Help
This causes a short description of the available options to print out, along
with the current version number.  Giving an invalid option gets you this
display, too.

5.7.4  -p  Pause
If you are running XYZ from the Desktop, you won't be able to see any error
messages when it exits, as the Desktop wipes them out.  Putting -p on the
command line will make XYZ prompt you to press a key before it exits.

5.7.5  -r<n>   Set retry limit
Ordinarily, XYZ will abort a transfer if more than ten errors occur.  When you
have had that many errors, the chances of an error slipping through undetected
become greater.  If, however, you want to take your chances, you can set the
retry limit with this command.  It can be set anywhere from the default 10 up
to 1000.  There must not be any spaces between the -r and the number.
Example:  -r50     Set XYZ's retry limit to 50

5.7.6  -s  Return status
This option is only useful if you are having some other program call up XYZ.
The -s option makes XYZ return a status code that indicates how the file
transfer went.  Use this only with a program that expects XYZ to return status
codes.  See the error messages section for details on what the errors mean.
The codes are:
  0  No error
 -1  Missing block number
 -2  Missing or bad header
 -3  Synchronization error
 -4  Timed out
 -5  Checksum error
 -6  User aborted
 -7  File error
 -8  Too many retries
 -9  CRC error
-10  Filename must be specified
-11  Bad escape character
-12  Bad or unsupported packet type
-13  Bad hexadecimal character
-14  Sender not ready or set to receive
-15  Subpacket too long
-16  Sender aborted
-17  File position error
-18  Sender indicates end of file, but file length is wrong
-19  Receiver canceled
-20  End of transmission not acknowledged
-21  Bad option on command line
-22  Not enough memory to allocate buffers

5.7.7  -t  Touch
This makes XYZ "touch" (set the time and date to the current time and date)
files that it downloads.  If the sender specifies a creation time and date for
a file, that is normally retained.  The -t option makes XYZ use the current
time and date instead.  If the creation time and date isn't specified by the
sender, the current time and date is put on the file.  XMODEM will always use
the current time and date.

5.7.8  -v<file>  Verbose mode
This causes XYZ to output special debugging information.  If no file is
specified, the output goes to the screen.  If a file is specified, it should
be directly after the "v" (no spaces), and output will go to it, along with
any error messages you might get.  If you have problems with XYZ, run it with
the -v option, and send the file it creates along with any comments to me.
When using a file, there must not be any spaces between the -v and the file
name.
Examples:  -v             Download ZMODEM, sending debug info to screen
           -ve:\log.txt   Download ZMODEM, sending debug info to "log.txt"
                          on drive E:
