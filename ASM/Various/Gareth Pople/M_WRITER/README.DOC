     The message writer allows you to display full screen scrolling 
messages on any ST with a colour monitor. The program takes a text 
file created by the user and displays it in a clear, readable manner.
Features include.
     
     o Text may be automatically justified, to the left or to the 
          right, or centralised.
     o The screen colours may be set using a small ASCII file, read 
          on boot up, and altered whilst the message is being 
          displayed.
     o The message may be paused at any time.
     o The letters, numbers, and punctuation are all proportionally 
          spaced.

     In the M_WRITER folder you should find
        
        M_WRITER.PRG            The main program.
        TEXT                    The text file to be displayed.
        COLOURS                 The default screen colours.
        README.DOC              This file.
        M_WRITER.S              The assembler source code.
 
     Please keep the folder intact and distribute it amongst your
friends.
     Message writer may be executed from an auto folder. Just put
M_WRITER.PRG in the auto folder leaving the files TEXT and COLOURS
in the root (=main) directory. Otherwise all the files should be 
in the same path (=folder).


How to use it.
--------------
        
     If you click on M_WRITER.PRG the program will execute loading 
TEXT and COLOURS. The sample text will start to move up the screen. 
You may control the program using the keyboard thus,

        Escape          Exit the program.
        Space           Pause the message (any key to resume).
        Cursor up       Increase the value of the background colour.
        Cursor down     Decrease the value of the background colour.
        Undo            Reset to default colours.
        Cursor left     Increase the value of the text colour.
        Cursor right    Decrease the value of the text colour.
        
        
How to create your own messages.
--------------------------------

     The characters defined are a to z and A to Z, together with
!"#$%^*()-+=':;<>.,?/~ and 0 to 9. The underline character is & 
(shifted 6), since underline is not an ASCII character.

     The TEXT file is in the following format.
        
     The character set is composed of three different sizes of 
characters. fijl!'()I:;., are all 8 pixels wide. All upper case
letters plus m and w are 24 pixels wide. The rest of the lower
case letters and all the numbers are 16 pixels wide. 38 of the 
smallest characters, 19 of the medium size characters and 12 of 
the largest characters, may fit across one screen. Of course 
all the different sizes may be mixed and used as desired.   


| (the key next to Z shifted) will justify text to the left.
                
        eg      message|
          
@ (the key to the left of RETURN shifted) will centralise text.

        eg      message@
        
\ (the key next to Z unshifted) will scroll the screen up a row.

        eg      message@\       (line is centralised then scrolled up)
        
] (key to the left of RETURN shifted) signifies end of message.
     When this if reached the message will replay from the start.
        
        eg      MESSAGE@\       (big chars centralised then scrolled up)
                message|\       (small chars left justified and scrolled)
                &&&&&&&|\       (small characters then underlined)
                ]               (message will now replay from start)
                
Putting no control code after the text will right justify the text.

        eg      message\        (text right justified and scrolled)

     
     The |(left justify) and @(centralise) control codes will have 
no effect if text has been scrolled on that is wider than the screen.
        
        eg  THIS IS TOO LONG@\  (will scroll on and be moved up, the @
                                                 won't have an effect)
                                                 
        eg  THIS IS TOO LONG|\  (as before the | code has no effect)
        
     However the next control code (| or @) used will now have an 
effect.

     Messages can be scrolled along the bottom of the screen without 
moving upwards if that is desired.

     If you are still unclear then refer to the file TEXT to see how
the sample message is produced.         

     If the TEXT file is not found then a message 
"DISK ERROR file not found" will be displayed.


 
How to set the default colours.
-------------------------------

     If the program cannot find the COLOURS file the colours will 
default to white text on a black background. If the file is found the 
default colours will be read from the file.
        
The file can be edited with a text editor and is in this form

006,000

which signifies an RGB value of 006 (light blue) for the text and an
RGB value of 000 (black) for background. If you don't stick to this 
format you will probably get some really horrid colours.

     Although the program M_WRITER.PRG is copyright me, I give my 
permission for it to be freely distributed. This program is 
shareware, and any donations will be gladly received.

     If you have a font that you would like to use in this program
just send me a disk containing the font, in degas or neo format,
together with a few quid, and you will receive your disk back, 
containing all the versions of this program including one which
features your own font. Please remember fonts must be low resolution,
single colour, and all characters must be 8 or 16 or 24 pixels wide,
(any character may be either of the three widths) and 23 pixels tall. 
If your font features characters taller or shorter than 23 pixels 
then be a bit more generous, as this means more work for me.
