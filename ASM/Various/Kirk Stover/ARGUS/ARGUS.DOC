                   ARGUS & XARGUS Info File.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Argus & Xargus were written to provide an easy way to keep track of
what a program currently running is doing (reading) on the disk.

Argus intercepts the Bios call RWABS (see you bios doc) and displays
the parameters. It also displays the address from where the bios was
called, as well the error number returned by the bios.
(If you don't know what i'm talking about here, don't worry, you won't
need using these programs then.)

Xargus does a similar thing to the XBIOS call Floprd. (Xbios call #8)

The exact display format of both is as follows:

Argus :
$<call address> <drive>:<r/w> R#<rec.nbr>, #<rec.count> <error#>
n.b. r/w is displayed as arrow-left for read,arrow right for write

Xargus
$<call address> <drive>:<side> T<track>,S<sector>, #<rec.count> <error#>
n.b. 'side' is displayed as arrow-up for side 0,arrow down for side 1

To install one or both of them,just start them (you won't get any message,
but they will be there.)
You should start Ramdisk programs BEFORE argus, as they also intercept
the RWABS vector. (It will not crash, but if the starting order is reversed,
the ramdisk operations will not be traced by argus. If this is what you
need, install the ramdisk second.)
Don't install argus / xargus twice, there's no check currently to see if they
are already there or not, so you will loose memory and execution time for
nothing.

This is the first argus/xargus version, the source should be provided too,
I would be very pleased to hear about enhancements.
Just return your version to the person that gave you this one, if that person
does the same thing, it will reach me sooner or later.

Happy hacking ,
