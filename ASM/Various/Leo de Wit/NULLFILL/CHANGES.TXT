      The original NULLFILL.PRG has a feature that would flash the top
of the screen on and off very quickly. The programs author thought that
no one would notice the flash: I noticed and became so annoyed that I went
and found the NOT.L (A0)+ instructions and NOP'ed them.The file NULLFLLM.PRG
is the exact same file as NULLFILL.PRG with two changes:
1)The flash had been taken out. The program does the SAME thing as before
only without telling you.
2)The title screen now says NULLFILL Speedter Modified instead of
N_U_L_L_F_I_L_L. This is so you know that its not the original its been
slightly changed.
      I did this because sometimes the top of the screen would STAY
inverted. This happened whenever ArcShell ran ARC.TTP. The ARC.TTP worked
fine only for some reason it stayed inverted.
