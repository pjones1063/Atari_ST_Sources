As you were able to see, everybody that you have met are members of the SECT. Since not so long ago, all the inhabitants of the village were eliminated: they got in the way of our secret activities... Since the beginning we have been following you. We could have got rid of you a long time ago...@@@ 
Ý
I, Great Master, decided to leave you living just to see how far your courage would go. Not one of your activities went unseen. We let you carry out your quest to the end... Thinking you were doing well, you have thrown yourself into the lion's jaws!  
Ý
The success of your venture has allowed us to discover the treachery of the cook who we have distrusted for some time now. The fact that you have succeeded in finding the spell book confirms that it isn't sufficiently in security here.@We therefore have nothing more to do in this village.@  
Ý
Our doctrine must now spread out to other places. I leave you living because I like people of your calibre, but give up the idea of taking the spell book because, if by any strange coincidence we should meet again, you will experience the anger of MOLOCH, our great master.@GOODBYE  
Ý
Your confidence has betrayed you!@The icy water swallows you body and soul...@@Nunc est bibendum...
Ý
Nobody should disturb a black magic session!@One glance from the Master and his diciples send you from life to death.@@Beati pauperes spiritu...
Ý
To be in possession of the spell book means taking great risks... Before finishing your action, you feel a cold blade being plunged in your ribs!

The effects of the potion were immediate!@Your legs give way...@During a restless sleep you feel the monk search you, take you somewhere and then abandon you on an icy cold floor...Your torper begins to wear off. 
Ý
Disguising yourself would have helped to avoid certain troubles...The person you were talking to got angry and hit you on the head.
Ý
In your semi-inconscience, you feel that someone is dragging you to an unknown destination...  
Ý
Your doubtful actions displeased many people.@The sentence was final: somebody brutally killed you.@@But who?@@This question will stay with you, unanswered until the end of time!
Ý
Ok! You weren't on holiday...@Three days have gone by since the beginning of your adventure. You were not able to carry out your quest to the end. The members of the sect have left with the spell book.
Ý
You have, without doubt, often lacked vivacity...@You leave Hobdale immediately with the feeling of having failed in your duty.@And...@You are RIGHT...
