Ý
You're straining your eyes!
Ý
Stop taking the mickey! 
Ý
Weight lifting?
Ý
There's nothing to be done!
Ý
Letting off steam?
Ý
No way!
Ý
Oh, no!
Ý
You're turning in circles!
Ý
Silence...
Ý
Don't even ask!
Ý
Don't just do anything!
Ý
Look elsewhere!
Ý
Useless!
Ý
Don't just put it anywhere!
Ý
Forget it, you'll been seen!
Ý
Have you got the fidgets?
Ý
Indeed, it turns...
Ý
It's open.
Ý
It's closed.
Ý
It's already closed.
Ý
Nothing special...
Ý
You find...
Ý
Nothing else...
Ý
It's in the bag!
Ý
It's taken...
Ý
An old piece of paper...
Ý
What an achievement!!
Ý
If I were you, I wouldn't do anything! 
Ý
A wooden bowl... 
Ý
Fragile, handle with care!
Ý
Don't do that, stupid! 
Ý
Come on...be serious ! 
Ý
It's been empty for a long time...
Ý
Hmm... hmm...
Ý
Little clown!
Ý
Good try!
Ý
Ho, heave!!
Ý
Impossible!
Ý
Nothing to be done.
Ý
Who's a pretty boy then!
Ý
Solid oak...
Ý
Sturdy!
Ý
The mystery of old stones...
Ý
Old rags...
Ý
Nothing special!
Ý
Why?
Ý
There's no point in pressing!
Ý
A big rat...
Ý
What would you do?
Ý
Nothing to do with the Chapel Sistine!
Ý
Rusty but solid...
Ý
Don't touch!
Ý
Why so much hatred?
Ý
That's all!
Ý
It's too heavy!
Ý
Let's see...
Ý
It moves! 
Ý
For goodness sake, what are you doing?
Ý
It's almost that...
Ý
Have some respect for the dead!
Ý
Dimwit!
Ý
You're working yourself up for nothing!
Ý
Have you lost your head?
Ý
It's worth a detour!
Ý
Hopeless...
Ý
No result!
Ý
Ineffective...
Ý
Too solid!
Ý
A family jewel?
Ý
In a sorry state...
Ý
You're going to break it!
Ý
Not very deep...
Ý
Empty!
Ý
That's all...
Ý
There's no need to overload yourself! 
Ý
We're not in Dartmoor prison!
Ý
Don't touch!
Ý
A brief glance...
Ý
What are you doing? 
Ý
Others have tried before you...
Ý
Nothing special!
Ý
Worm eaten...
Ý
Carved from the block... 
Ý
Old paving...
Ý
Wierd as much as strange...
Ý
???
Ý
A rope...
Ý
Good idea!
Ý
Medieval ornament...
Ý
Have you discovered something?
Ý
Functional!
Ý
Solid!
Ý
Just a trunk!
Ý
13th century...
Ý
An ordinary helmet...
Ý
The armour is fixed to the ground...
Ý
A glimmer of hope?
Ý
Bolted!
Ý
Ok!
Ý
Ok!
Ý
With what?
Ý
Ok!
Ý
And the time goes by...
Ý
Nothing in particular...
Ý
No clue...
Ý
Negative !
Ý
Watch out for the lumbago!
Ý
You lack common sense!
Ý
Is it really necessary?
Ý
Nothing happens...
Ý
A useless effort!
Ý
Bad move...
Ý
You distress me!
Ý
Don't push your luck!
Ý
A good hiding place!
Ý
It's alright where it is...
Ý
Don't disturb everything !
Ý
You're not an expert in pulling!
Ý
It's stuck!
Ý
There's no handle...
Ý
Don't just pull anything!
Ý
Use your brain!
Ý
It isn't a handle...
Ý
You make my head turn!
Ý
It would look out of place...
Ý
Damn!
Ý
Peeping Tom!
Ý
He has seen others!
Ý
Don't get irritated!
Ý
Don't break it!
Ý
No ill-considered action!
Ý
It's too dark!
Ý
I can't see anything!
Ý
I'm afraid of the dark!
Ý
Not in these conditions!
Ý
Some light, please!
Ý
I'd like to see you do it!
Ý
It's not a bright idea!
Ý
I'm not too keen on that idea! 
Ý
Hopeless...
Ý
There may be another way... 
Ý
That would be better!
Ý
It's more discreet!
Ý
You're going about it in the wrong way!
Ý
It's more sure!
Ý
You're right, let's be careful...
Ý
Not so easy!
Ý
The candlestick and the table make one... 
Ý
One in the other...
Ý
What do you mean?
Ý
Rustic furniture... 
Ý
Vandal!
Ý
Are you moving house?
Ý
A seat...a back rest...four feet...What more can I say?  
Ý
Not very interesting.
Ý
Little clown!
Ý
It isn't a sedan chair!
Ý
Forty centimetres thick!
Ý
Bruce Lee?
Ý
Curiosity kills the cat!
Ý
We're not in Berlin!
Ý
Stone by stone?
Ý
Freestone...
Ý
No way!
Ý
You are curious!
Ý
You live in hope...
Ý
The hood...
Ý
The hearth...
Ý
Ashes to ashes...
Ý
Hobdale's registry book...
Ý
A small key... 
Ý
Why so much violence?
Ý
A ring...
Ý
I don't give a damn!
Ý
Weight lifter?
Ý
That's nice furniture!
Ý
It isn't very conclusive!
Ý
It's alright where it is!
Ý
Strange...no wardrobes...
Ý
Leave the coin
Ý
Peeping Tom!
Ý
No! no!
Ý
You're turning in circles!
Ý
Don't break a coin! 
Ý
Thick velvet...
Ý
A find?
Ý
I wouldn't do anything!
Ý
An unsuccessful search...
Ý
Don't take them down!
Ý
Neither seen nor known...
Ý
Plain decoration...
Ý
It's too high!
Ý
We're not at the theatre!
Ý
Your brain is overworked? 
Ý
Inaccessible!
Ý
Good initiative, unfortunately unsuccessful! 
Ý
Too modest?
Ý
A game of hide and seek!
Ý
Very clever!
Ý
Wierd!
Ý
Nothing underneath...
Ý
Not very smart!
Ý
You must be joking!
Ý
Verboten!
Ý
Oh, no!
Ý
Very bulky...
Ý
There you are...
Ý
It doesn't contain anything...
Ý
What a ludicrous idea!
Ý
The list of Hobdale's inhabitants.
Ý
Already done!
Ý
Nothing better to do to get noticed!
Ý
Well, well??
Ý
A mysterious hiding place...
Ý
It isn't the same stone who was in Basic Instinct. Shame!
Ý
Once, that's enough!
Ý
You vandal!
Ý
Again?
Ý
It's almost that!
Ý
A strange medallion... 
Ý
You're going about it in the wrong way.
Ý
Not deep enough.
Ý
Very dark!
Ý
It's hollow...
Ý
???
Ý
Don't overload yourself unnecessarily!
Ý
You are overloaded! The choice isn't easy...
Ý
It's beginning to get heavy!
Ý
Where are you going to put everything that you're carrying?
Ý
An old wooden barrel...
Ý
What's cooking?
Ý
The oldies bar...
Ý
A small terracotta pot...
Ý
The bosses reserves!
Ý
A well stocked shelf...
Ý
An old paraffin lamp...
Ý
It isn't lit!
Ý
A pewter jug!
Ý
Recently swept...
Ý
Well piled up stones.
Ý
Slightly smoky.
Ý
Not very important.
Ý
A simple strip of wood.
Ý
A glass container.
Ý
A small tap...
Ý
Hot and glowing. 
Ý
A simple pub table...
Ý
The innkeeper does not allow it!
Ý
Sandy and dry ground.
Ý
A dead tree...
Ý
Not looking good, the poor chap...
Ý
The corpse of a dwarf...
Ý
The rope is securely attached.
Ý
The object of the crime
Ý
A small and useful coin.
Ý
A crafty fox.
Ý
A reinforced door.
Ý
A symbol of death!
Ý
A pile of heavy stones...
Ý
Sandstone...
Ý
A retaining wall.
Ý
A few clouds...
Ý
A strange ring...
Ý
What nice music... 
Ý
Grass and bushes...
Ý
The hangman is too high!
Ý
It prevents the draughts!
Ý
It won't be of any use to you.
Ý
You are too small, my friend!
Ý
It's useless...
Ý
Have some pity for the dead!
Ý
I prefer not to have heard anything!
Ý
You're not La Fontaine by any chance?
Ý
Ouch! my tail...
Ý
How could I go about it?
Ý
Even hitting hard, it resists. 
Ý
The steel is too thick.
Ý
Use your imagination!
Ý
Go ahead, it'll do you good!
Ý
Action, always action!
Ý
A simple fireplace.
Ý
Closed shutters.
Ý
Wooden shutters.
Ý
Paved floor.
Ý
You are very curious!
Ý
The door of the inn.
Ý
The door is closed.
Ý
Local tiles.
Ý
Old roofing. 
Ý
A quick glance!
Ý
A wall among many others.
Ý
The window of the inn.
Ý
The innkeepers' cat. 
Ý
Not very deep.
Ý
Clear and limpid water.
Ý
A pile of logs...
Ý
The miaowing cat inn.
Ý
The old village oak...
Ý
Nice weather, eh? 
Ý
It most probably lights up a bedroom...
Ý
Where in the hell do you think you are?!!
Ý
A wooden panel...
Ý
It's locked from the inside...
Ý
The paving stone doesn't move...
Ý
I have looked but there's nothing!
Ý
Have you lost something?
Ý
The water is really too cold...
Ý
It's too dirty.
Ý
My arm isn't long enough... 
Ý
It's the innkeeper that won't be happy and when you meet the chap, you'll understand why you shouldn't argue with him!
Ý
I prefer wine!
Ý
The bar moves...
Ý
I prefer not to have heard anything...
Ý
It's tiring...
Ý
There's no chance of it falling!
Ý
I like people with a good sense of humour!
Ý
You'll need to lengthen your arm.
Ý
Nothing moves here...
Ý
Why so much violence?!
Ý
Don't break it!
Ý
He who breaks must pay!!
Ý
What a way to behave!!
Ý
It isn't forbidden to dream...
Ý
Are you violent, by any chance?
Ý
Especially not a black cat!
Ý
It'll end in tears!
Ý
It's forbidden!
Ý
Too hot!
Ý
Could it be the gallows bird.
Ý
Don't steal!
Ý
Out of the question!
Ý
There's no point in touching that!
Ý
Ouch! it burns!
Ý
A spiders web.
Ý
A manure fork...
Ý
An old worn out rope...
$
A little wooden stool.
Ý
An old pile of wet straw.
Ý
A tool rack.
Ý
A hefty little fellow!
Ý
What a smell!
Ý
Miracle!
Ý
You're looking for trouble?
Ý
A wall cut out in rock!
Ý
A French style wardrobe.
Ý
A simple wardrobe door.
Ý
A simple handle...
Ý
That's all very bright!
Ý
A heavy stone block!
Ý
That's a good old beam! 
Ý
A table without any ornaments...
Ý
A metallic coat-hanger...
Ý
A cassock in your size.
Ý
A terracotta paving stone... 
Ý
Apart from a cassock, not much else... 
Ý
Always stones...
Ý
This one doesn't have any pockets...
Ý
It should really be left in its place...
Ý
Why break such a beautiful piece of furniture?
Ý
What a devilish idea!
Ý
Keep calm. 
Ý
It'll end in tears!
Ý
Do you want to burn your fingers?
Ý
You're crazy!
Ý
Spiritualism?
Ý
No more good ideas?      
Ý
If that's what you want then don't let me bother you! 
Ý
No luck on this side...
Ý
What strength!
Ý
A stone...
Ý
It's a perfectly normal stone!
Ý
A blunt knife... 
Ý
A bulky rock.
Ý
A simple pebble.
Ý
Calm down, old friend!
Ý
Do you like getting noticed?
Ý
It doesn't move!
Ý
I'm pressing, but in vain!
Ý
What a clown!
Ý
Too dusty!
Ý
No point in scratching, there's nothing! 
Ý
You're going to wear yourself out... 
Ý
This action is useless...
Ý
What energy!
Ý
The cross of John the Baptist.
Ý
Do you think the weather will be nice?
Ý
A heavy paving stone...
Ý
This paving seems to be loose.
Ý
A pile of stones.
Ý
Mystery of old towers...
Ý
Thick vegetation.
Ý
A thorny hedge.
Ý
A wild shrub.
Ý
The Northern passage.
Ý
Are you testing your strength?
Ý
Let's see, my Lord!
Ý
No notorious discovery.
Ý
A tomb...
Ý
A skull...
Ý
It's not the right one!
Ý
Sheltered!
Ý
There's no more room!
Ý
It's impossible, the load would be too heavy. 
Ý
A horse shoe.
Ý
A huge spiderweb!

Call for a prayer...

A corn field.
Ý
A prickly hedge...

Wild honeysuckle...
Ý
The cross is solidly fixed!
Ý
Covered in moss...
Ý
It's not allowed!
Ý
Do you like jokes?
Ý
Just you try!!
Ý
There's no point...
Ý
Dry sandy ground...
Ý
A bar...
Ý
A wooden gate...
Ý
No abuse!
Ý
Sacrilegious!
Ý
Vade retro Satanas!
Ý
May the devil be with you!
Ý
Be off with you, vandal!
Ý
What a sight!  
Ý
Some grass...
Ý
It's a signpost...
Ý
You're looking for bad troubles!
Ý
Leave the poor thing alone!
Ý
Don't touch!
Ý
In its place!
Ý
A small hamlet, faraway...
Ý
A piece of soap...
Ý
An old wooden bench...
Ý
A sweet little path...
Ý
Don't go and break it!
Ý
A small wall... 
Ý
Oh, what a beautiful mountain!
Ý
Some pastures...
Ý
Some clover and lucerne...
Ý
Maybe there's an other way to do it!
Ý
It's an old oak tree...
Ý
A small pond...
Ý
A passage...
Ý
Nothing to report!
Ý
Not much.
Ý
The mountain, faraway...
Ý
Don't worry, its not going to rain!
Ý
A solid crank!
Ý
The bail from the well.
Ý
A hazel-tree...
Ý
The arch over the well is covered in honeysuckle.
Ý
An old well.
Ý
A crucifix!
Ý
Hard ground...
Ý
A mysterious lock...
Ý
How?
Ý
Poor thing!
Ý
It must weigh almost a kilo!
Ý
It makes me shiver!!
Ý
He won't like that!
Ý
Urgh!
Ý
Have some respect for other peoples work!
Ý
What strength!!
Ý
Kidnapping??
Ý
The cross. 
Ý
A little respect, please!
Ý
A cross...
Ý
How will you get back up?
Ý
Apparently someone highly placed!
Ý
If that's what you want...
Ý
The best grinder in the region. 
Ý
Peter the priest. 
Ý
It is solidly fixed and can't be taken!
Ý
A long dark corridor... 
Ý
A heavy stoneware jug.
Ý
A locked door!
Ý
A wooden cross.
Ý
Towards the sky...
Ý
A shelf full of woodworm...
Ý
A valuable brooch.
Ý
Worn out by time...
Ý
It doesn't turn!
Ý
An axe...
Ý
Am I dreaming?
Ý
It's becoming an obsession!
Ý
Be serious and think.
Ý
It's hard...
Ý
Are you enjoying yourself?
Ý
Where did you see that?
Ý
Calm down, I'm getting tired!
Ý
What a bad move!
Ý
You're turning in circles!
Ý
A joke?
Ý
The ring doesn't turn.
Ý
Your sense of humour sends shivers down my spine!
Ý
What stupidity!
Ý
Don't hurt it!
Ý
A worm...
Ý
What could you take here?
Ý
A strange cavity...
Ý
A disconnected stone...
Ý
It would be a shame for later on!
Ý
No important discovery...
Ý
Could this be a spiritual session?
Ý
It doesn't open!
Ý
It doesn't close!
Ý
Rye bread...
Ý
Nothing special underneath!
Ý
This loaf is a bit dry!
Ý
A nice cup...
Ý
Oh, it's so funny!
Ý
The cup is empty.
Ý
A heavy dining table.
Ý
It's fine where it is!
Ý
No superhuman effort!
Ý
Stop turning the tables!
Ý
Not much!
Ý
No!
Ý
A good old door!
Ý
One doesn't take these kind of things.
Ý
It's getting very funny!
Ý
Don't be so nosy!
Ý
Using your strength?
Ý
This action is so inefficient !
Ý
No excessive lifting.
Ý
If only it could move!
Ý
Nothing special...
Ý
It's so dusty!
Ý
That doesn't belong to you!
Ý
The book doesn't contain anything.
Ý
That doesn't seem neccessary...
Ý
Jean-Claude VANDAL?
Ý
Still searching?
Ý
Nothing turns...
Ý
It doesn't open...
Ý
The shelf doesn't move!
Ý
It appears to be impossible.
Ý
It's really too tiring!
Ý
Leave it where it is!
Ý
It's unnecessary!
Ý
Breaking glass brings bad luck!
Ý
The bottle is empty!
Ý
The bottle is already open.
Ý
There's no lid.
Ý
That's odd, a paving stone is missing!
Ý
Nothing to lift here.
Ý
What is there to take here?
Ý
Apart from the dust, nothing else...
Ý
What are you saying?
Ý
Why break such a nice table?
Ý
Always in great form!
Ý
What do you want to find here?
Ý
The stone moves...
Ý
An odd small stone...
Ý
Don't dream!
Ý
It's impossible!
Ý
The stone moves...
Ý
Nothing turns.
Ý
A hinge.
Ý
It isn't the solution!
Ý
It can't be taken!
Ý
No additional element.
Ý
It's getting quite funny!
Ý
A very ordinary lock.
Ý
A supporting beam...
Ý
This bench is fine where it is!
Ý
What does it change?
Ý
It doesn't move!
Ý
Keep your energy !
Ý
Why? It isn't useful!
Ý
Don't hope that it'll move!
Ý
Don't just say anything!
Ý
Where do you think you are?
Ý
I think you need a rest!
Ý
I like to take my time...
Ý
You lack inspiration!
Ý
Don't touch!
Ý
There's no doubt about it, we're not getting anywhere.
Ý
Go and find a locksmith!
Ý
Appalling!
Ý
You surprise me!
Ý
No opening here!
Ý
Don't be greedy!
Ý
I don't want to.
Ý
You're going mad!
Ý
Nothing to open in this corner!
Ý
Shut what?
Ý
Does that do you any good?
Ý
Looking for a support?
Ý
You're turning in circles!
Ý
I feel dizzy!
Ý
A foot! 
Ý
Getting your kicks?
Ý
There's no point in getting excited!
Ý
Oh no! There's still nothing!
Ý
You surprise me there!
Ý
What are you doing?
Ý
You can't take that!
Ý
Apart from old flour...
Ý
Leave it, it's not worth it! 
Ý
Ham from the region.
Ý
Hard ground.
Ý
The rope is tightened.
Ý
A thick wooden door.
Ý
A paving stone slightly cracked...
Ý
Nothing to lift!
Ý
What do you want to take?
Ý
No success on this side!
Ý
I can't find anything!
Ý
A torch!
Ý
No way!
Ý
What are you looking for?
Ý
One on the wrong side and one on the right side.
Ý
I have a sore shoulder!
Ý
If only I could help you!
Ý
Don't pretend to look!
Ý
It's fixed to the wall.
Ý
No obvious opening.
Ý
There's nothing to shut!
Ý
A small hinge.
Ý
Don't be stupid!
Ý
Trying your luck?
Ý
You'll get your fingers pinched!
Ý
You can't do that!
Ý
Try something else!
Ý
How are you going to go about it?
Ý
No sign of a clue.
Ý
Is this going to continue much longer?
Ý
Your good ideas are rare!
Ý
The stone doesn't open!
Ý
A two-edged sword!

Don't pull it!
Ý
A Persian carpet.
Ý
What do you want?
Ý
A candlestick with three branches.
Ý
The candlestick isn't hollow. 
Ý
Oh! So many feathers.
Ý
It's so light!
Ý
You have worked well!
Ý
It's light!
Ý
What else do you want to do!
Ý
It's all soft!
Ý
You've already slashed it!
Ý
Particular trace...
Ý
It makes you wonder...
Ý
A small valuable stone.
Ý
Leave it as it is.
Ý
The box is empty...
Ý
Nothing is open...
Ý
Paving stone...
Ý
You can be very ridiculous sometimes.
Ý
The shield doesn't open.
Ý
It's closing time.
Ý
An oil lamp.
Ý
A small hook.
Ý
Finally, the famous spell book!
Ý
Very deep!
Ý
Not chicken again!
Ý
Just you try!
Ý
A very sharp knife...
Ý
Not here!
Ý
A cutting table...
Ý
Wood for the fire...
Ý
Don't nick that!
Ý
Red ashes!
Ý
Go and get your head sorted.
Ý
Are you fakir?
Ý
A cast iron cooking pot.
Ý
I know someone who is going to get kicked out of here.
Ý
It tickles!
Ý
Be careful with it!
Ý
Botanist?
Ý
You're not a medium!
Ý
Leave it, there's no point!
Ý
There's nothing to pull!
Ý
If it falls, it'll break! 
Ý
A stone wall.
Ý
What nice legs!
Ý
It doesn't give a good impression!
Ý
Hands off!
Ý
Let go!
Ý
One legged!
Ý
A very particular emblem.
Ý
A comfortable chair.
Ý
It's alright where it is!
Ý
You can't take that!
Ý
Leave it here!
Ý
May the devil be with you!
Ý
That would be the solution but how?
Ý
A precious object.
Ý
It isn't finished!
Ý
You need tact.
Ý
Nothing at all!
Ý
Yes but how?
Ý
It's too deep!
Ý
A very mysterious trap...
Ý
You can't do that!
Ý
An impossible action!
Ý
You won't succeed like that!
Ý
It's unbreakable!
Ý
I don't think it'll ever turn!
Ý
Nothing that could help you here.
Ý
You're not responsable for it!
Ý
Think a bit!
Ý
The lamp is solidly fixed to the wall.
Ý
Nobody allows it!
Ý
A canvas sack.
Ý
It contains some corn...
Ý
An unimportant bag...
Ý
A knob... 
Ý
How can one lift up a knob?!
Ý
How? I don't understand.
Ý
It isn't the ideal solution!
Ý
It'll be a shame for later...
Ý
I have never seen anyone search a thing like that!
Ý
The knob doesn't open!
Ý
What are you doing?
Ý
The knob doesn't turn!
Ý
A drawer.
Ý
It doesn't turn.
Ý
A small coin.

Ý

Ý
A very strange shield.
Ý
A little coin.
Ý
A solid steel bar...
Ý
I can't see anything in the dark!
Ý
A very special kind of lock.
Ý
A worm eaten shelf.
Ý
A boring empty bottle.
Ý
A rusty and unimportant box.
Ý
Don't annoy me.
Ý
Not a hint of a clue.
Ý
The top of the armour.
Ý
A hood...
Ý
A small cast-iron door...
Ý
A small bench...
Ý
A heavy door...
Ý
You're going about it in the wrong way, try something else!
Ý
You'll be further ahead afterwards.
Ý
The ring doesn't open!
Ý
No, this rope isn't long enough.
Ý
Some belladonna...
Ý
You put the cassock on immediately
Ý
A socle...
Ý
A very ordinary torch...
Ý
One of the Great Master's disciples.
Ý
Here, silence isn't golden.
Ý
Give what to who?
Ý
The man is asleep!
Ý
The man with a mask!
Ý
It'll end in tears!
Ý
You'll end up getting hit!
Ý
Be careful, he'll get angry!
Ý
It tickles!
Ý
That's enough!
Ý
An ordinary candlestick.
Ý
Well played!
Ý
Not a hint of a clue underneath there.
Ý
Are you not feeling well?
Ý
There's nothing new.
Ý
One doesn't break a pillow.
Ý
It's soft!
Ý
It's all very soft.
Ý
It's stone...
Ý
A classic lock!
Ý
There's no point!
Ý
Not at all!
Ý
Oh no!
Ý
Leave it!
Ý
I like ham!
Ý
Let's leave it shut!
Ý
Are you crazy?
Ý
How should we go about it?
Ý
By the tail?
Ý

The sword is securely fixed@Only a strong man could take it...But your adventures have tired you out.
Ý
A thieving magpie.
Ý
The ring is placed in the shield.
Ý
The door closes!
Ý
Very ingenious, the door opens!
Ý
The rope breaks, the knife breaks and the dwarf falls.
Ý
The door closes behind you!
Ý
Not very interesting manuscripts!
Ý
It heats well!
Ý
Feathers...
Ý
A stone...
Ý
The lever takes away the paving stone under your feet.
Ý
Martin, the Yorkshire rocker!
Ý
That's manners for you!
Ý
Hello, I've lost my score. Could you help me find it!
Ý
Don't leave me in this awkward position. Have you found my score?
Ý
How I love music!
Ý
I prefer the Yorkshire rock!
Ý
Leave me alone. That's enough now!
Ý
Don't play with your health kid!
Ý
Thank you! It's my favorite piece. In exchange, I give you this page of missal. 
Ý
What do you want me to do with it?
Ý
You are well loaded! Shame, I know that my offering would be very useful to you.
Ý
Looking for something?
Ý
The washerwoman.
Ý
Who has nicked my soap? I can't have lost it again!
Ý
Oh no! Where is my soap?
Ý
I haven't even time to talk with all this work! 
Ý
What a shame! So much hard work!
Ý
Thanks lad! Here, take this safety pin to close the collar of your shirt.
Ý
Thank you but I don't need it.
Ý
It's nice of you to come to church. Alas, I have no more wine for the mass.
Ý
Could you find me some wine for the mass, please?
Ý
The visit in the chapel will be well worth your while.
Ý
Have you lost your head?
Ý
One doesn't push around church people!
Ý
Vade Retro Satanas!
Ý
Thank you, my son! Here's the key to the chapel. May God guide you in your quest.
Ý
Go in peace, my son!
Ý
Here's the object that I was telling you about. 
Ý
It would be nice if you could find me something to eat. 
Ý
A small sandwich wouldn't be refused!
Ý
Thank you, my lad! Couldn't you find me a piece of bread!
Ý
Thank you for the bread! Couldn't you find me something to accompany it?
Ý
All I have is this tablet that I found on a path. Here you are! Make good use of it!
Ý
Hi kid! How are your researches going?
Ý
Hobdale...
Ý
Where do you want to take me? I'm fine here!
Ý
Don't take advantage of a poor fellow! 
Ý
Be careful of the one who sleeps!
Ý
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Ý
Just what I need to make a nice sandwich.
Ý
The price of the passage is a ring.
Ý
You can't pass without a ring!
Ý
Suicide candidate.
Ý
I'm warning you! I don't like being pushed around.
Ý
If you have a knife to sharpen, don't hesitate.
Ý
And there's the work done!
Ý
I will sharpen it for a nugget.
Ý
Ok, you may pass!
Ý
Are you teasing me, it's fake!
Ý
It's not enough!
Ý
One can't buy me for so little!
Ý
Don't get on my nerves!
Ý
No success!
Ý
St John the Baptist.
Ý
The arm seems to be articulated.
Ý
A stoup...

Ý
Since it's fixed, it's cross! 
Ý
An alter...
Ý
A missal...
Ý
A secret passage way!
Ý
A pew...
Ý
A rough voice answers you:@"Moloch will be our perdition!"
Ý
Ding Dong!
Ý
The bottle of acid is empty.
Ý
Here, one pays in cash!
Ý
No credit is given here!
Ý
Here, it's for you!
Ý
I have some wine for you but you have nothing to carry it in.
Ý
Here...it's just been cooked!
Ý
An amulet...
Ý
The Great Master!
Ý
Thank you! Now leave us because only the High Dignitaries may see the Masters face.
Ý
Don't disturb me during my duty.
Ý
That's enough, I have nothing to say!
Ý
Don't bother, I won't accept anything!
Ý
Be careful, you'll regret it!
Ý
It's gay!
Ý
Not here! Are you crazy!
Ý
Ah...it's tough!
Ý
Finally, a proof!
Ý
You can do better!
Ý
Sinister individual...
Ý
Be quiet, says the Master!
Ý
I will only speak in the Masters presence.
Ý
Don't try and bribe me!
Ý
That's enough!...Keep your trivialties to yourself!
Ý
How dare you raise your hand to me!
Ý
I really don't advice it!
Ý
I will grant you three passages in exchange with three stones.
Ý
To pass, give me a precious stone!
Ý
It doesn't look easy!
Ý
Ok! You may pass!
Ý
It isn't necessary because the door is already open!
Ý
Ok! It's more prudent! The door is locked again!
Ý
Everything in its own time!

You are hidden behind the trunk.
Ý
The cooks recipe has worked wonders. They are all asleep!
Ý
zzzz...zzzzz...zzzzz...
Ý
Thank you. I am Nicholas the innkeeeper, the last keeper of the spell book.
Ý
Now you must discover the truth!
Ý
I am also...
Ý
...a member of the BLACK SECT!
Ý
...and you are not at the end of your surprises...
Ý
I introduce you to...
Ý
The guard from the guards room:
Ý
"It was me! Hello stranger..."
Ý
The guard from the mysteries room:
Ý
"I will pray for the salvation of your soul!"
Ý
The guard from the corridor:
Ý
"How nice to see you again, young fool!"
Ý
The guard from the dining room:
Ý
"I have composed a requiem for you. I'm quite proud of it actually!"
Ý
The GREAT MASTER:
Ý
"Your courage hasn't been very useful, stranger...Now read what follows..."
Ý
Apparently, it isn't crowded.
Ý
Brrrr...He sends shivers down my spine!
Ý
If you want me to open the door, give me a sign of recognition!
Ý
To pass, make yourself known!
Ý
Ok! You are definately one of us, you can pass! 
Ý
Ok! I have recognized you, you can pass!
Ý
The man is dressed in a cassock...
Ý
But, what are you doing@You are not one of us?
Ý
It isn't the right time for joking!
Ý
MOLOCH is in its place@I will take you to the sects hiding place...
Ý
Like the planet that leaves its trajectory, the Prince of Tears isn't in its place!
Ý
What are you doing here?@Do you want to disappear like the rest of them?
Ý
You must go and take the meal now!
Ý
Thank you! I will need it to prepare the potion!
Ý
The ingredients that you brought me have allowed me to prepare a potion that I have mixed with the Great Master's meal!
Ý
Disappear now, I am in great danger!
Ý
Have you got the necessary ingredients to prepare the meal?
Ý
Bring me the necessary ingredients for the preperation of the potion.
Ý
You must give this dinner to the High Dignataries.
Ý
It's best to keep your distances...
Ý
Only the disciple who brings the meal to the High Dignataries can pass!
Ý
Seeing as you have the meal you may pass!
Ý
The High Dignataries are hungry!
Ý
Only the High Dignataries may know the way that leads there...
Ý
You must therefore take this potion that will take you into a trance...
Ý
Your interlocutor wants to give you something@but you are already over loaded.
Ý
Ok...@Listen, it seems that water is flowing in the distance...
Ý
The door closes automatically. 
Ý
Ah! The exact formula...
Ý
The arm of the sacrifice.
Ý
The acid wears away the padlock...
Ý
Three ears of corn.
Ý
It's a lock!
Ý
The sign! Finally...
Ý
The shutters are locked.
