Ý
Is it really necessary?
Ý
There's nothing to read!
Ý
Nothing in particular...
Ý
Boo hoo!
Ý
Is it really useful?
Ý
It isn't necessary...
Ý
Sometimes, I wish I was deaf! 
Ý
I don't want to!
Ý
No clumsiness!
Ý
Don't touch!
Ý
There's nothing written, but nevertheless...
Ý
Old yellowed paper...
Ý
That's not very pleasant!
Ý
Fragile, handle with care!
Ý
It's empty...
Ý
Roughly cut.
Ý
Yuk!
Ý
No indications...
Ý
It's a touchwood lighter...
Ý
No distinctive smell.
Ý
It's a large iron key...
Ý
It isn't kept for this use.
Ý
It doesn't contain anything...
Ý
There's no label...
Ý
Made of glass!
Ý
An old smell of arsenic...
Ý
There's maybe something better to do!
Ý
Complete madness!
Ý
It's roughly five metres long.
Ý
A smell of hemp...
Ý
I do feel sorry for you!
Ý
It doesn't open!
Ý
No inscription...
Ý
Worthless...
Ý
You need a good nose!
Ý
Go and ring yourself elsewhere, pigeon! 
Ý
That seems interesting!
Ý
The parchment smells smoky...
Ý
Do you think so?
Ý
Quite a rough texture...
Ý
A big piece of work...
Ý
???
Ý
Apparently, it isn't a door key...
Ý
The parchment is ripped...
Ý
He is very polite!
Ý
The medallion doesn't open...
Ý
What could this sign represent?
Ý
It seems to be in a good condition...
Ý
Don't go and break it!
Ý
The parchment is ripped and the indications are incomplete.
Ý
Ok!
Ý
You are overloaded, the choice isn't easy!
Ý
It's beginning to get heavy!
Ý
Where are you going to put everything that you're carrying?
Ý
A ring with a very special ornament...
Ý
It could surely act as a lever!
Ý
It's sturdy!
Ý
It is done just right!
Ý
Stop, you're going to damage it!
Ý
THE BROKIT. Home made produce...
Ý
BROKIT:it's production goes back to the dawn of time. Does the bible not say?:"Jesus took the bread and BROKIT"
Ý
What a smell!
Ý
Just to get rid of the smell!
Ý
It's very malleable.
Ý
Search a wire??
Ý
The wire is rusty.
Ý
It's been dry for a long time.
Ý
It has already been used...
Ý
It smells of lavander.
Ý
Careful, it cuts.
Ý
An excellent blade of quality but...
Ý
The handle is made of horn.
Ý
A good sharpening would be welcomed.
Ý
In a good condition.
Ý
It's definitely gold.
Ý
There you are...
Ý
Is it really useful?
Ý
Made of metal.
Ý
As you wish!
Ý
Come on, be serious!
Ý
That's nice to see!
Ý
Hiding ones savings!
Ý
A special barbaric organ!
Ý
There might be something better to do!
Ý
Let's leave that for a while.
Ý
Well, what a pretty object.
Ý
It's solid.
Ý
There's nothing inside!
Ý
They're your size.
Ý
Make good use of it.
Ý
No outcome.
Ý
Special gold diggers.
Ý
It is in a good condition.
Ý
Did I hear correctly?
Ý
Odourless!
Ý
Rough and solid material...
Ý
Not one find...
Ý
Wash at 40C.
Ý
Your size.
Ý
Probably a furniture key.
Ý
That's an idea.
Ý
That's a good knife.
Ý
Careful, it cuts.
Ý
An excellent blade of quality.
Ý
Don't play with food.
Ý
A loaf.
Ý
Obviously, it was cooked on firewood.
Ý
I've had enough.
Ý
Made in Taiwan.
Ý
A nice pot...
Ý
I've got a stuffed up nose.
Ý
They've drunk it all!
Ý
Capacity: 3 litres.
Ý
How sad the jug is empty.
Ý
It contained beer.
Ý
Now, that's good bread.  
Ý
Now don't lick your fingers!
Ý
It gives off a bittersweet smell!
Ý
Save it for something else.
Ý
Tidying your belongings?
Ý
What is there to say?
Ý
Strange smell!
Ý
A poisonous plant!
Ý
Come on, be serious!
Ý
A knife.
Ý
Don't be nosy...
Ý
Looking for sensations?
Ý
A step...
Ý
No particular smell...
Ý
I'll have heard everything!
Ý
Provisions for the demonstrations?
Ý
What a touch!
Ý
It's all seen.
Ý
Mysterious object.
Ý
Fragile, handle with care!
Ý
The shape is very odd. What could it be used for?
Ý
It doesn't smell of anything.
Ý
It's you who decides.
Ý
It contains acid!
Ý
Dangerous product.
Ý
It clears the nostrils.
Ý
Be careful, it's fragile!
Ý
I'd like to but how can I go about it?
Ý
You discover...
Ý
Empty...
Ý
Nothing else.
Ý
The Dignataries box.
Ý
Always the alert nostrils. 
Ý
It's very strange.
Ý
Careful, it stings!
Ý
A nappy pin..
Ý
A fork for the hay.
Ý
It's impossible.
Ý
I.N.R.I.
Ý
What does it mean?
Ý
1 coin...
Ý
A very ordinary key.
Ý
Bad move!
Ý
The jug is filled with one measure of corn.
Ý
The jug is filled with two measures of corn.
Ý
The jug is full. It contains three measures of corn.
Ý
What more is there to say?
Ý
This shield is very ordinary.
Ý
A precious stone of 9 carat gold!
Ý
A super pendant.
Ý
For the most dignified.
Ý
Are you joking?
Ý
Why not?
Ý
What are you talking about?
Ý
Voodoo ritual.
Ý
Don't be stupid!
Ý
Come on chick...
Ý
O.K.
Ý
Nothing new!
Ý
Nothing inside!
Ý
Prayers and pious exercises.
Ý
A smell of incense.
Ý
Sacrilege!
Ý
A leather cover!
Ý
The desired manuscript.
Ý
Are you joking?...It was hard enough to find it!
Ý
You must really be a fool!
Ý
One doesn't play with food.
Ý
Don't judge a book by its cover, it's good.
Ý
Don't bother inviting me.
Ý
Don't play with food.
Ý
Some corn.
Ý
I like the smell of corn.
Ý
Let's see.
Ý
A smell of buckwheat.
Ý
Bread deposit??
Ý
A nice loaf of bread.
Ý
Full of wine.
Ý
Leather!
Ý
I'm pleased.
Ý
It is full up of strange liquid.
Ý
Letters appear on the paper...
Ý
What do they mean?
Ý
It might be a larva of a big white worm.
Ý
You find...
Ý
Nothing else...
Ý
Powder, only powder...
Ý
A small ordinary box...
Ý
Vitamins L, G, K...
Ý
You absorb the potion immediately:@an intense heat invades your muscles and you feel your strength increase. 
Ý
Jet black and as round as an eye!
Ý
You discover HELP engraved in the ring. 
Ý
It's sad an empty jug...@Even if it is an engraved jug.
Ý
