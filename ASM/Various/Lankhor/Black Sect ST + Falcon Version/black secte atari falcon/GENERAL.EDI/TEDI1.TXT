Ý
A musical tune reaches your ears...
Ý
Nothing moves...@However you have the impression that you are being spied on.
Ý
The heavy silence that reigns here,@is disturbed only by the sound of@running water from the fountain. 
Ý
Suddenly,@you hear foot steps behind the door... 
Ý
Not a sound nor a whisper. 
Ý
You can here a slight noice coming from the hedges...
Ý
It's strange, you get the impression that the currant is stronger! 
Ý
Suddenly, you notice that the grass has been trampled on...
Ý
Obviously,@not long ago,@somebody passed by here.
Ý
You feel a slight draught...
Ý
Some muffled sounds seem to be coming from the cracks in the ground...
Ý
Brrr...@It's sinister here.
Ý
You notice a slight creak behind you!
Ý
Where are these strange noices coming from?
Ý
The level seems to be rising...
Ý
The level seems to be dropping...
Ý
What are those sounds that you can here in the distance?
Ý
You can hear muffled sounds coming from the floor.
Ý
You notice the sound of a large object@being trailed in the room next door...
Ý
Be careful!@There are voices in the chapel...
Ý
You have a horrible impression that you are being followed. 
Ý
A furtive shadow has just disappeared behind the pillars.
Ý
Something stirs in the corn field.
Ý
You can here metallic gratings not far away.
Ý
A sarcastic laugh echos a few metres away from you.
Ý
Abruptly, a draught freezes your body!
Ý
There are foot steps coming from behind the gate. 
Ý
A strange grating,@coming from the next room,@rings out...
Ý
A smell of roast chicken embalms the room.
Ý
You notice the worn stones...@It gives the impression of many "comings and goings"
Ý
For a fraction of a second,@you thought you saw someone leaning over the top of the well.
Ý
The curtains seem to move...@Wierd...
Ý
You have a horrible feeling that someone is watching you.
Ý
All of a sudden, strange metallic sounds ring out from behind the door. 
Ý
A fresh breeze, coming from the west,@brings a smell of burning tobacco.
Ý
A grating,@coming from the next room,@makes you shudder...
Ý
Nothing moves, it's peaceful...@However...
Ý
The old timbers creak!
Ý
A strange smell comes to your nose...
Ý
Suddenly, you hear the sound of a door being slammed!
Ý
Not a living soul...@But one feels a strange presence.
Ý
But... Yes!@Someone is whispering behind the door!
Ý
Someone is marching up and down in the next room.
Ý
A strange creaking!@Could the gate have closed itself?
Ý
A slight draught,@coming from the wall on the left,@freezes your feet.
Ý
Suddenly,@sounds of saucepans ring out from behind the door! 
Ý
The calm that reigns here forsees nothing good...
Ý
Suddenly, a deep laugh interrupts the silence!!!
Ý
Your presence seems to disturbing the innkeeper...
