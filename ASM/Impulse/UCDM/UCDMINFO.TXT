UCDM MDOULES
            in my way!

            by: Lance!
----------------------------------------------------------
This packed lharc file should contain:
UCDMINFO.S             <- This text
UCDM.UMP\LANCE!V4.UMP  <- 50 kHz 4 channel ump file
UCDM.UMP\LANCE!V8.UMP  <- 50 kHz 8 channel ump file

These umps should work fine on STe,MSTe and hopefully the
TT.
----------------------------------------------------------
Ok so there exist many umps already.What so special about
these?
First thing is that the 50kHz 8 channel ump works on a
normal 8Mhz STe and as far as I know this is the first
ump that does this.
Since I mostly work on a monochrome monitor I don't know
what the maximum time is for the 8 channel ump is but
should be around 85%.
The other one is a 4 channel ump that theoretically
should take around 35% maximum.
----------------------------------------------------------
There is probably several bugs left and you all people
out there have the honour to be my beta testers.
In other words use these ump file on your on risk!
I can't be hold responsible for damaged ears and stereos.
-)
If someone test this on a TT or MSTe please contact me and
tell me how it (not?) worked on them (I have no access to
these computers).
----------------------------------------------------------
Need I say that coders lives not just on CC or Pizza alone
Nope,we need encouragement too or we will turn into
Nintendo/Sega/Jaguar(YEAH!) playing zombies or worst of
all we will join the DARK side and begin to develop
Windows(tm) products in Pure Pascal *BURRRR*.
So please !!!! If you like these ump or any other of my
codes ... ENCOURAGE ME!!!! (Last in this text  a list of
things that will encourage me).

If I offended anyone in this text, before you call your
lawyers,sit down, have an apple. No have two. One red and
one green and look at them. If you can't make out which
one is green and which one is red you are probably color-
blind. Life sucks and now you know it.
----------------------------------------------------------
P.S. If someone interested in the source codes give me a
     call.
