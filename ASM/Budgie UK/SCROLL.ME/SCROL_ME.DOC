SCROL_ME.PRG
------------

SCROL_ME.PRG reads an ascii file called text.asc
It will operate in low res, but you may run it from
whatever mode you are in.
Because, the vertical blank vector has been re-routed,
previously-loaded music will be cut out.

Exit the scroll by pressing 'UNDO'

The character set is limited to 48 characters:

!;"();',.?:    10 numerals   and  25 letters
and two graphic characters.

type asterisk *  if you want the happy face  ****       
type hash #  if you want the matches  # # # # #     


This program has been put together by Gary (Goth) Wheaton.
Gary's labels are rather down to earth. No frills for the
casual onlooker...
