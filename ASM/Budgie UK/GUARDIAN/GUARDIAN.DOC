GUARDIAN.PRG
-----------
This is a small program used on all the latest BUDGIE UK games
which acts as an anti - virus Early Warning System.
A small friendly piece of code will be written on your boot sector.
It will produce a greeting flash each time you boot your disk.
Should the greeting FAIL to appear, an uninvited virus is present!
Simply re-run this program and the virus will be erased.
It uses the leap-frog theory: the last code to write itself on disk
is always the active one.
Keeping the write protect on is of course very useful. But some
games (including Budgie's) save high scores to disks.
In fact, at Budgie, the principle is: WRITE-PROTECT disks you seldom use,
but DON'T write-protect the regular ones! If a virus is lurking
around, we'll soon catch it when the Guardian fails to greet...

GUARDIAN II (February 1990)
--------------------------
This version will display the greetings in MEDIUM RES and leave
your computer in MEDIUM RES. It protects your disk and SOLVES
the STE bug at the same time. No AUTO folder needed!

Finally, do NOT use this program on a commercial disk that uses its boot
sector.  If a commercial disk auto-boots without having an AUTO folder,
then it uses the boot sector: leave it alone
