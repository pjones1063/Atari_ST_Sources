INCLUDE1.S   2.S   3.S   4.S
----------------------------

These assembly language files are required in order to
assemble some of the source files on this disks.

Together with MACRO.S  and SOUNDS.S, they form part of Budgie's
68000 routines library.  The full collection of routines,
together with the SHELL.S game maker is available separately
on Budgie's PRODUCTIVITY disk #2.  Ask your licensed distributor.

SHELL.S is required to form a ready-made arcade game structure,
with full graphics and sound support.
Current version is v.41 January 1990


So, what does SHELL.S do anyway?
The shell is an ENVIRONMENT from which to control a game
and call any macros and subroutines that may be required.
Let's be more specific:

1.  It 'includes' a few handy macros
2.  It then goes into supervisor mode
3.  It gives back to gem (m_shrink) any memory it doesn't need to
    start with.
4.  It finds out where ram top is
5.  It asks gem to reserve some space (malloc) for work areas
    which will be needed later on (spare screens, buffers,..)
    I also asks gem to reserve space for files to be loaded soon
    (sprites for instance)
6.  It initializes the A-line so that we may change the fonts later on.
7.  It hides the mouse, the cursor, etc..
8.  It goes into low res, unless monochrome is detected
9.  It loads the new fonts from disk, and some tunes.
10. It installs the horizontal blank interrupt routine, if any
11. It resets the bombs vectors
12. It installs the vertical blank interrupt routine, if any
13. It does the same with the mfp interrupts
14. It checks whether ascii files have been interfered with...
15. It checks whether the boot sector is still clean (virus)
16. It executes the opening sequence (title page, etc..)
17. It initializes the sprites
18. It installs the joystick handler routine
19. It installs the mouse handler routine (optional)
20. It declares some of the main initial variables
21. It declares logical_screen and physical_screen
22. It builds up the required scenery
23. It goes on the the MAIN LOOP, called 'main'

Fine, the prolog is over.
Now for the MAIN LOOP.
This is the conductor of the orchestra.
The program counter comes back to this LOOP 50 times a second,
even if there is nothing to do (if PAUSED for instance).
Our program is therefore said to be running at 50 frames.
50 frames means smooth graphics.

What does this MAIN LOOP do?

1.  It reads the JOYSTICK (or mouse).
    If there is a request, a BRAnch is made to this appropriate routine
2.  It reads the KEYBOARD. If a key has been hit, again
    a suitable BRAnch is made.  Approx 33 keys can be detected.
    With the exception of ESC, P, and Functions, most of them
    are for de-bugging purposes.
    A BRAnch to one of these routines is terminated with
    a BRAnch back to main (and not with RTS)
3.  It then swaps the 2 video pointers so that at the next 
    vertical blank, graphic operations will be directed
    to the screen NOT being displayed
4.  It now waits for the vertical blank. At this point, the video
    chip redraws the screen (which is the one we were working on
    during the LAST cycle)
5.  The coordinates for all 'automatic' sprites are now being updated
6.  Software vertical scroll is executed if asked for
6.  The clock is updated. So is the score, etc..
7.  It checks whether the level or the game is finished
8.  All sprites are RESTORED. The background is temporarily spriteless
9.  Individual PIXELS are read and drawn (if required)
10. All targeted backgrounds are SAVED unless unnecessary
11. Finally, all sprites are DRAWN in their new positions.
    All this restoring/saving/drawing takes place on the screen
    which is NOT BEING SHOWN (logbase)
12. it now checks whether such minor things as Pause or
    Slow Motion are required.
13. at this point, a 1/50th of a second has almost elapsed
    and it's time to go back to MAIN !
