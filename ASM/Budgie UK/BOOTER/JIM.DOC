BOOTER.PRG was written by Jim Holmwood.

1. Run BOOTER.PRG

2. Choose a small program to be slotted on the boot sector.

Program must be written in PC relative code,
terminate with 'RTS'
and be less than 450 bytes long.

There are three such examples in this folder,
(bootdem1,2,3)

Choose any one of them. They are harmless.

Remember, BOOTER.PRG will write on your boot sector.
So don't use a valuable disk to experiment.
