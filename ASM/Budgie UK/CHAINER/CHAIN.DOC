CHAIN.PRG
---------

A 'chainer' program, or 'loader' is a program that launches
one or several other programs.

The chained programs need NOT have the usual PRG/TOS extensions.
In fact any name will do.

Have a look at the source code.  Names are at the end.
Even if you don't have an assembler the principle should be fairly
easy to follow, as it's all based on the $4e 'exec' gemdos call 
(trap #1).

In our example, the first program chained is 'lisa_14.prg'.
Lisa waits for a key to be hit, then returns control to the calling 
program (chain.prg)
Chain.prg then calls the next program 'raster_5.prg'.
Again, a key (ESC) is awaited. Control jumps back, once again,
to the calling program. Eventually, the calling program ITSELF
terminates, and hands over to gem.
