benoît ST

wooh... first st code since hm i guess 7 years... well was more or less a test:
a) to see how long it will be compared to the amiga ocs version
b) to check out vasm

a small 192 byte mandelbrot (including file header) for atari st and
a small 216 byte mandelbrot 4 planes (including file header) for atari ste (uses ste colors)
you do not need to switch the resolution to run this thing!

the effect will not return after execution... start at your own risk !
tested only on emulator with the quick starts...

ah well... very busy since round about 1 1/2 year now. working on my house
means almost no time for other things... damn i really home this is soon over.
i'm really scene under coded :)

greetings to cream and equinox ! ;)
