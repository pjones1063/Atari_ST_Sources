How to use the XGrabber...


Plug your Jaguar-Joypad in STE-Port A of your Falcon. Run the file 
"XGRAB_J.PRG". With "A/B/C" you can save a screenshot to drive C. It's 
named "GRAB????.GFX". To use this picture you have to convert it into a 
more usual format with "GFX->###.PRG". Up to now I have not implementated 
much formats. Sorry!
There are more options build in the XGrabber. For further informations 
read the german manual.   :-(
