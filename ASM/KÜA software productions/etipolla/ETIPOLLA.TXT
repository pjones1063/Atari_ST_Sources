KšA software productions present:

Eti polla


Source actually written on the guest
book of a christening I attended today.
I thought, instead of the usual boring
wishes why not spice things up a bit?
(the rasters were a last minute
inspiration - and I managed not to make
a single smudge on the book. Although
my handwriting leaves a lot to be
desired ;))

It ran first time correctly when I
typed it at home - actually running the
assembled code to check for correctness
is for the weak! Although size
optimisations suffered a bit for this.
Anyway, I guess this makes it the first
impromptu Atari ST wishtro?:)
