---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program enclosed provides a convenient method of making useful patches 
to the GFA-BASIC 3.x interpreter and compiler.

At the start, select the Basic interpreter or compiler (GFA_BCOM.PRG). 
After that you will be taken to the settings dialog box.

Something in advance: Please take care not to save the patched program(s) 
under the same name as the original(s). We accept no responsibility for the 
functionality of the patches, anyone who damages his own interpreter and 
does not have a backup, only has himself to blame!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patching the compiler
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two changes can be made to the compiler or to the library:

- Insertion of an improved INIT section
- A bugfix for the crash under Mag!X

Both patches can be made individually or in one go. The Mag!X patch only 
changes the GFA_BCOM.PRG file, the INIT patch also updates the library.

In the patch dialog box, you can enter the new names that should be used to 
save the compiler and the library. If necessary, you can also use the 
original library again in case the preset name is not correct.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patching the compiler 1: New INIT section
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can get precise information about the new INIT section by reading the 
text file LIBPATCH.TXT. The listing ERR.LST contains some examples of
how to use the new features.

Important: The LIBPATCH folder _must_ contain the files HIDEM.O, INIT35.O 
and INIT36.O!

Clicking on 'Patch' will start the automatic patching procedure. At the 
end, you should try to create a new index file (GFA3BLIB.NDX) using the 
program MAKE_NDX.PRG. This program (you should have received this with the 
original package containing the compiler) will search first in the original 
library folder and then in the folder LIBPATCH. If this fails, the file can 
still be chosen using the file selector. If this also fails, then the 
program will terminate. You should be aware that in this instance you will 
have to create an NDX file 'by hand'. If you can avoid this situation, so 
much the better.

Hint: If you do not have the MAKE_NDX.PRG program, you can obtain this from
GFA Systemtechnik (good luck with that) or send your original diskette and
a stamped, addressed return mailer to G. Duchalski and the adress mentioned
above.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patching the compiler II: MAG!X bugfix
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The compiler crashes under Mag!X with the message "Memory block destroyed".
This is the cause:

The compiler uses MShrink (GEMDOS 74) to reduce its memory requirement as 
neccessary. Using Malloc (GEMDOS 72) it then checks for the largest 
available memory block and allocates this amount less 16 Kbytes. 
Unfortuantely, the program assumes fom this that the allocated memory lies 
directly after the area previously shrunk. In general this is true. Under 
Mag!X, it lies before the allocated memory block (the address that was 
returned by MAlloc) which is indeed the so-called MCB, 'Memory Control 
Block'.

This contains
- An identifier ('ANDR' or 'KROM' a greeting to one of the programmers
- The length of the allocated block
- The base page address of the program, to which the block belongs
- A pointer to the last MCB.

The GFA compiler overwrites the MCB. After the compiler terminates, Mag!X 
checks whether the chain of MCBs is still intact and then reports the error 
described.

By the way: This problem also occurs under MultiTOS. However, in this case 
it can be removed by simply setting the memory protection flags in the 
program header to GLOBAL.

Through the use of the patch, the GFA compiler no longer uses the first 
16 bytes lying after the MShrink memory block and therefore dose not 
overwrite an MCB. The behaviour of the compiler remains nevertheless 
incorrect, so that the area allocated does not unconditionally lie after 
that which is still in use by the compiler (although as a rule this is 
true).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patching the interpreter
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This provides either practical configuration patches, as documented
by GFA or the correction of errors.

Interpreters that can be patched:

 Version:     File length:

  3.6TT          104770
                 104766
                 104739
                 104597 (English version)
  3.5E           103510
                 103337 (English version)
  3.50           102519
                 102523
  3.07           92894
  
What will be patched in the interpreter?

 - No more LINEA calls:
   Also see LIBPATCH.TXT. When moving the mouse in the editor you may get 
   some residual images, but not while a program is running.
   
 - No more SETCOLOR calls, that change the colors on the TT:
   GFA Basic make some errors with the internal setting and querying of the 
   screen colors, so that in resolutions like TT Medium, some colors are 
   changed after running the interpreter. This patch prevents this. Also 
   the command SETCOLOR will no longer have an effect. The better command 
   VSETCOLOR should be used as a replacement.
   Hint: Please take note that additional patches made to the editor colors 
   in conjunction with the SETCOLOR patch will have no effect either!
   
 - MERGE will no longer abort when ASCII 4 is encountered within the text:
   The interpreter normally aborts the merging of files at the 
   corresponding line when it encounters ASCII 4 (EOT == End of trans-
   mission, CONTROL D, left arrow). Under UNIX, ASCII 4 is the EOF 
   character which was one of the greatest ambitions of GFA Systemtechnik. 
   This patch removes this disrupting behaviour.
   
 - CALL bug removed:
   The CALL command in interpreter version 3.6 D TT with a size of 104770 
   bytes does not work because of a typing error (movem.l a4/a6,-(sp)
   instead of movem.l a4-a6,-(sp)). The patch repairs this command.
   
 - Free system memory:
   When starting, the interpreter reserves all available memory for itself 
   apart from 16 Kbytes. This is especially a problem on non-TT machines 
   since too little memory is available for accessories and they refuse to 
   work. This patch allows you to set the amount of memory that will remain 
   free (e.g. 32Kbytes).

 - Activate 'New names':
   The 'New names' option from the Basic's system menu will
   be activated automatically.
   
 - The DEFLIST preset

 - The editor colors
   Hint: These do not work when the 'No more SETCOLOR calls' is active at 
   the same time.
   
 - The default variable type can be entered without Postfix.
   This is preset to Float.

 - No CLS when strating program
 
Patching is basically simple: Once you have selected the patches you 
require, select the "Patch.." button. The patched version of the 
interpreter will then be saved under a new name.

        04.10.93 - A brief information dialog now appears when the program 
                   is started.

0.99    23.01.94 - New INIT section. The old one contained an error in
                   conjunction with floating point varaibles.

                 - The program no longer uses LINEA.

1.00    07.02.94 - The SETCOLOR patch did not work with V3.50 of the 
                   interpreter.

                 - An additional patch has been added: The size of the 
                   memory which remains free after starting the program can 
                   be changed. The default is 16 Kbytes the least that is 
                   practical when using accessories e.g. (ERGO!help).
                   
                 - 3D effects under MultiTOS and Mag!X were incorrect.

                 - If SHIFT, CONTROL or ALTERNATE is pressed when starting
                   the program, the info dialog no longer appears. The file 
                   selector appears instead.
 
1.01    10.04.94 - The LINEA patch for the interpreter with 102523 Bytes 
                   was incorrect.

                 - The memory patch would only work on the ST until the 
                   next RESERVE call occurred. This was then reset to 16 
                   KB.

        15.04.94 - A successful patch operation is now confirmed with an
                   appropriate message.

1.02    15.05.94 - The SETCOLOR patch for V3.5 of the interpreter with
                   102519 Bytes did not work (Andre Muller).

                 - Since the editor colors patch does not work at the same
                   time as SETCOLOR suppression, the corresponding option
                   will be diabled (David Reitter).

1.03    20.07.94 - A few internal changes, some further security checks
                   were added and some adaptions for the new English
                   version.

                 - The 'Patch...' button will be disabled if no patch
                   is chosen for the interpreter.

1.04    11.08.94 - Included support for English 3.6 interpreter
                   (104597 bytes).

1.05    29.08.94 - 'New names' patch included.

1.06    07.09.94 - Included support for English 3.5E interpreter
                   (103337 bytes), thanx to Bob Samuel.

1.07    05.10.94  -Included support for French 3.6TT interpreter
                   (104740 bytes).

                  -ERR.LST and the new FILESELECT replacement can
                   be found in the LISTINGS directory.

        22.10.94  -'Patch...' was not selectable if only one of the
                   last three patches was chosen.
