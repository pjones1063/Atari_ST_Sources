          We've recorded a public-domain demonstration program that shows
          some of the outstanding features of the new Regent Base 2.  The
          demonstration program only runs on Atari ST computers with color
          monitors.  The demonstration program is in the public-domain, so
          feel free to make copies of it:  Circulate it in your local user
          group library, give a copy to your local dealer, show it to your
          friends.  But, don't make copies of the SQL Add-On.  Piracy
          directly hurts the author's efforts to provide the ST community
          with new and exciting software.
          
          The SQL Add-On uses the same SQL commands as Regent Base 2, so
          if you decide that a complete GEM applications development
          environment is for you, Regent Base 2 will be comfortable and
          easy to understand.
