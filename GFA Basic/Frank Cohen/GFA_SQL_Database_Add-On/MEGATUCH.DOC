          Los  Angeles, CA -- October, 1988 --  Regent Software today
          began  shipping  MMeeggaattoouucchh,  a keyboard stiffener for Atari
          520  and  1040  ST  computers.   At a list price of $11.95,
          MMeeggaattoouucchh  firms  the  ST  keyboard  to feel like a Mega ST
          computer.
          
          "When  the  Mega ST computer began shipping last year, most
          ST  users  wanted to buy a Mega for the enhanced keyboard."
          reports   Tom  Mason,  engineer  of  Megatouch,  "The  Mega
          keyboard solved the "mooshy" feeling of the 520 and 1040 ST
          keyboards."
          
          MMeeggaattoouucchh was test-marketed in the Southern California area
          with  outstanding  results.   Atari  520 and 1040 ST owners
          found  it  easy  to install MMeeggaattoouucchh, average installation
          time is less than 10 minutes.
          
          MMeeggaattoouucchh carries an $11.95 list price and is now shipping.
          
          With  over  250,000  Atari  1040  and 520 STs already sold,
          MMeeggaattoouucchh is turning out to be an inexpensive HOT accessory
          product just in time for Christmas sales!
