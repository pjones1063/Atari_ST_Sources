     To  call Regent Base 2 simply a database just doesn't do justice to a
     truly  amazing  new  product.   Regent  Base  2 is a 4GL SQL database
     system.   A  Fourth  Generation  Language (4GL) lets you control your
     computer's  devices (screen, mouse, disk, etc.) using a language like
     BASIC   or  PASCAL  with  application  development  in  mind.   First
     Generation  Languages  could  be  considered  machine  code, programs
     written in a complex numbering system that, for the most part, only a
     computer understands.  Second Generation languages are assemblers and
     utilities  that  convert  simple  english commands into machine code.
     Third  Generation  Languages  are  high-level  languages  like BASIC,
     PASCAL and FORTRAN.
     
     Regent Base 2 gives you the capability to develop GEM applications on
     your  ST  computer  using  its own language and interface. Instead of
     having  to  get  your  hands dirty with C code or PASCAL programming,
     where  you have to talk to the GEM operating system directly, you can
     easily and quickly create your own ST programs because you don't have
     to recreate the wheel everytime you want to write a program.
     
     The  Structured Query Language (SQL, usually pronounced See-Quel) was
     developed  by  IBM  for novice main-frame database users, in 1987 SQL
     became  the official standard American database language (ANSI X3H2.)
     Regent Base was the first and only database to give you this terrific
     language  on  the  Atari  ST  computer,  even before the standard was
     adopted.
     
     Regent  Base  is  the  ideal system to develop database applications.
     Regent  Base's advanced and powerful use of the GEM system makes many
     applications   possible:    School  Grading,  Accounts  Receivable  /
     Payable,  Mail  List  Management, Estimating, Financial Cost Control,
     and,  Inventory  Analysis.   But  don't  think  the  list ends there.
     Regent  Base doesn't put limits on your creativity, the possibilities
     are endless!

     What's New In Regent Base 2?!
     
     The new system has all of the robust features of the old system, plus
     many  new and unique functions have been added.  All of the component
     programs  have  been  completely overhauled with incredible speed and
     power  increases.   Regent Base 2 is now the leading database for the
     ST in terms of speed, flexibility, power and ease-of-use.
     
     The   improvements  in  Regent  Base  2  generally  fall  into  these
     categories:
     
     - Easier Editing
     - New FORM Objects & Features
     - More SQL and Procedural Commands
     - Incredible Data Access Speed Improvements
     - More Powerful Applications
     
     New  text  editing  functions  have  been  written to improve the GEM
     operating  system.   GEM  lacks  advanced  text manipulation commands
     available  on  other  computer systems.  The Macintosh, for instance,
     allows  text  to be selected in regions using the mouse.  The ability
     to select words, sentences, and paragraphs has been missing from most
     Atari  ST  programs  because  of  GEM's  limitations.   Regent Base 2
     improves  the  GEM  system by adding all of the features available to
     Macintosh    users:    Mouse-text   manipulation,   word   selection,
     cut/copy/paste  functions,  word-wrap  around,  justification,  and a
     clipboard for sharing text between programs.
     
     The  FORMS  EDITOR program has been completely rewritten and contains
     several  surprising new features and components.  Most of the changes
     center  around  a  new philosophy of designing Regent Base FORMS. The
     new  FORMS  EDITOR  is  based  on  a  "Computer  Aided  Design" (CAD)
     metaphor,  where  the  Atari ST video screen becomes the desktop of a
     drafting  table.   Objects  may be grouped by selecting more than one
     object  at  a  time.  If a group of objects has been selected, all of
     the  objects  in  the  group  can  be  moved,  colored,  removed, and
     otherwise  be  modified  as  though  the  group was one large complex
     object.
     
     The  visual  presentation  of  Regent Base's FORMS has always sparked
     some  excitement  in  viewers  and users of Regent Base applications.
     Several new objects have been added: Boxes, Circles, and Icons. These
     objects  may be stretched, colored, moved and manipulated anywhere on
     the FORM video screen.
     
     Regent  Base  2  now supports four pages of objects within each FORM.
     Complex  applications  can  use  the  additional  pages of objects to
     create  several  screens for data input/viewing.  Your own data entry
     sequence may be set within the multiple screens of objects.
     
     The  SQL  FORMS  PROCESSOR  has  been  completely rewritten.  The new
     system  is  lightning  fast, full of new commands, and much easier to
     use.   Regent  Base  2  is  written in 68000 assembly language, which
     makes its data retrieval and manipulation speeds extremely quick.  In












     a database table of one thousand records, finding a record at the end
     of  the  table  will  take  less  than  nine  seconds.  Using the new
     ULTRAINDEXING  system,  the  same  query  will  take  less  than four
     seconds.  Updating, deleting, and inserting records is just as quick.
     
     Regent  Base  2  uses  two  different  methods  of  sorting data when
     retrieving  ordered  information.   The  highly  acclaimed  QuickSort
     method  produces  lightning  fast results.  A table with one thousand
     records  will  sort on three or more keys in less than six seconds if
     all of the records can fit into memory at once.  Sorting files larger
     than  available  memory usually takes less than one minute, depending
     on  your  hard  disk or floppy.  The Insertion sorting method is also
     used if your data files are relatively small.  Insertion sorting also
     works  extremely  quickly  yielding  sorting  times  of less than two
     seconds for five hundred records.
     
     In addition, the list below summarizes some of the additional changes
     that have been made:
     
     -  The  FORMS  EDITOR  GEM  objects  have  been  reworked to give you
     additional parameters, functions, and capabilities.
     
     -  Eight  sorting  fields  may be defined when sorting tables.  Older
     versions  were limited to three key fields.  Key fields may be sorted
     in  ascending  or  descending  order  independently  of  the  others.
     Capitalization may also be ignored on any of the sorting key fields. 
     -  The Ultraindexing system corrects the many bugs that were found in
     Regent  Base  1.0  and  1.1's  indexing  system.  The resulting speed
     increases  are  staggering.   Using  a table that has been indexed on
     three  fields,  searching  a table of one thousand records takes less
     than  four seconds. We tested the same query with Regent Base 1.1 and
     found  the  results to take more than three minutes to complete.  See
     "Create Index" in Chapter 11 and Appendix A.
     
     -  CONTROL and ALTERNATE keys may be used by your applications to key
     board  equivalent  characters for commands.  See "User$" in Chapter 7
     and "Keys" in Chapter 11.
     
     -  FORMs  may be installed as a GEM Desktop application. From the GEM
     Desktop,  a  FORM  may be double-clicked to commence Regent Base. GEM
     will  run the SQL FORMS PROCESSOR and pass the name of the FORM to be
     run.  The  SQL  FORMS PROCESSOR will begin and automatically open the
     Regent Base FORM.
     
     -  The  Atari  Corp. sanctioned CLIPBOARD now allows you to move text
     from  one  program  to another.  The CLIPBOARD physically exists as a
     data  file  on  your  default  system  diskette.   The file is called
     CLIPBORD.SYS  and  contains ASCII data that may be loaded into a word
     processor or other program.
     
     - PROCEDURAL PROGRAMS, small programs may automate commonly processed
     commands, may be created individually from creating a FORM.
     
     -  TRANSFER  is a new drop-down menu that lets you move directly from












     one  part  of  Regent  Base to another, without returning to the MAIN
     MENU.
     
     -  The  CLEAR  PROCEDURE  drop-down  menu  of  the SQL Editor / Forms
     Processor has been moved to the EDIT drop-down menu. The new keyboard
     equivalent is CONTROL P.
     
     - SHOW PAGE is a new procedural command used to display a page of the
     currently  running  FORM to the end-user. Regent Base 2 FORMS support
     up to four pages of objects within each FORM, therefore, new commands
     have  been  added  to support the multiple pages.  See "Show Page" in
     Chapter 11.
     
     -  All reported Disk Errors give english descriptions of the cause of
     the  error,  and allow the end-user to RETRY the disk activity before
     signaling an error to Regent Base.
     
     -  All  of  your  data  tables  and  PROCEDURAL  PROGRAMS  are  fully
     compatible  with  the  new  Regent  Base  2.  Most commands have been
     reworked  to  accept the syntax of Regent Base 1.0 and 1.1 PROCEDURAL
     commands, plus they accept some new enhancements.  See Appendix F.
     
     Note:  It  is  strongly advised that you REORGANIZE all of the tables
     created  with  Regent Base 1.0 and 1.1.  The REORGANIZE command makes
     subtle  modifications  to  the internal format of the table that will
     improve Regent Base 2's performance.
     
     - SHOW; is a new procedural command that displays the contents of the
     SCREEN (S) output device.  See Appendix F.
     
     - Up to 32 levels of parenthesis may be used within expressions.  See
     "Parenthesis" in Chapter 7.
     
     -  Date  field  subtraction  is  now  supported.   See "Variables" in
     Chapter 7.
     
     - Regent Base 2 uses internal record pointers for every table.  Older
     versions  of  Regent  Base used one common record pointer which would
     become confused after many multi-table query and update commands were
     issued.
     
     -  GEM objects may now be referred to by Object Name.  The old method
     was to reference objects by Object Number.
     
     - R is a new output device that sends data to the serial port of your
     ST  computer.   The serial port is usually used to connect a modem or
     serial printer to your ST.
     
     -  Justification, word wrap around, column width, and line breaks are
     now supported when printing textual data.
     
     -  PAUSE is a new procedural command that waits a specified number of
     seconds before continuing to the next command.
     












     -  TITLE  is  a  new  procedural  command that adjusts the title of a
     window.
     
     -  GEM  is  a  new  procedural command that allows FORMs to run other
     FORMs, launch GEM programs, and return to the GEM Desktop.
     
     - EDIT is a new procedural command that allows a specified EDIT field
     to be the currently selected object of a FORM.
     
     - Regent Base 1.0 and 1.1 would crash when loaded into an ST computer
     running  Atari's  GDOS, graphics operating add-on to GEM. Regent Base
     2.0 has been tested with GDOS with no abnormal behavior reported.
     
     - Error codes have been completely reworked.
