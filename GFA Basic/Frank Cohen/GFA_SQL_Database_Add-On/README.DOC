               SQL Database Add-On for GFA BASIC (versions 2 & 3)
     
     The  SQL  Add-On  development team has been working for the past year
     fixing  and improving any bugs or other problems that were brought up
     by Add-On users.  This document file will be maintained with each new
     version  of the Add-On, to indicate fixes, repairs and changes to the
     original version.
     
     ---------------------SQL Add-On Version Notes--------------------
     
     Version: 11/22/88
     
     A bug was found and corrected that caused the aggregate functions not
     to work properly.
     
     
     
     Version: 10/19/88
     
     The  Add-On  program file name has been changed to GFAADDON.PRG.  The
     manual  incorrectly  reports the file name as SQLADDON.TOS.  There is
     no functional difference between the two file names.
     
     The  Add-On  may  be  installed in the AUTO folder of your boot disk.
     Using  the  AUTO  folder  insures  that  the  Add-On  will be present
     whenever  you turn on your Atari ST computer.  The Add-On manual does
     not fully instruct you on installing the Add-On for use from the AUTO
     folder.  Follow these steps to successful install the Add-On:
     
     a)  Create  a new folder named SQL.  From the GEM Desktop, choose the
     NEW FOLDER selection from the FILE drop-down menu.
     
     b)  Copy  all  of  the  files  from  the Add-On diskette into the SQL
     folder.
     
     c)  Run  the INSTALL.PRG file.  Click the INSTALL.PRG file icon once,
     then choose the OPEN selection from the FILE drop-down menu.  You may
     alternatively  double-click  the  INSTALL.PRG file icon.  The INSTALL
     program  is self prompting, and will eventually return you to the GEM
     Desktop.
     
     d)  Copy  the  PATH.TBL  file  icon  from  the SQL folder to the main
     directory of your boot diskette.
     
     e)  Copy  the  GFAADDON.PRG file icon from the SQL folder to the AUTO
     folder of your boot diskette.
     
     This  should  leave  you with a copy of the GFAADDON file in the AUTO
     folder, and a copy of the PATH file in the root directory of the boot
     diskette.
     
     f) Turn your computer off, wait 20 seconds, turn your computer on.

     If  everything has been done correctly, the Add-On will appear during
     the normal boot process.  The Add-On is now ready to use.
