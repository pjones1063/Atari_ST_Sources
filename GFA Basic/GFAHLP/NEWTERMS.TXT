                                  July 20,1993


   It is IMPORTANT that you read this file before sending in an update or
   registration form !!!

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=
   Starting July 1, 1993, ALL update and registration fees and terms are
   at the sole discretion of the author, Carl J. Hafner, and are subject
   to change without notice.

   The author retains ALL copyright, ownership and other property rights
   to ALL files and/or file collections.
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

                                 CURRENT TERMS
                                 -------------

      The following terms refer to ANY and ALL files or file collections
      of ANY type, written or produced by the author, Carl J. Hafner.

   1) Any terms of update and/or registration will be honored for a period
      not to exceed 90 days of a file and/or file collections release as
      long as the update and/or registration being submitted is for a version
      of the file and/or file collection which occurred within those 90
      days and as long as the terms of update and/or registration have
      been met for that particular file and/or file collection.

      What this means is that if you update and/or register within these
      90 days, you will NOT be subject to any increases which MAY occur
      within those 90 days.

      If you are planning to register and/or update a file and/or file
      collection and it is more than 90 days past the date at the top
      of this document and/or if it is more than 90 days past the
      release date of a file and/or file collection, you may wish to contact
      the author for a current list of titles, versions, terms and fees.

      This will ensure that the file and/or file collection you are updating 
      and/or registering is still available and that the update/registration
      fees you are sending in are current and correct.

      See below for ordering information.


   2) Anyone sending for a list of current terms and titles will receive
      a 30 day grace period (effective from the postmark date on the
      envelope). These 30 days will NOT be added to the 90 days referred
      to above unless the postmark occurs on the 90th day of a file or
      file collections release. Instead, they may run either concurrent
      or may even overlap.

      If you register and/or update during this period, you will NOT be
      subject to any increases which MAY occur during this time.

   3) At the discretion of the author, any materials which cannot be
      processed will be returned. The author may also choose to contact the
      party submitting an update and/or registration to inform them of the
      latest terms and fees. At this point the party will have the option
      of either sending in whatever materials may be required to fulfill the
      update and/or registration terms, or of having any materials which have 
      been submitted, returned.

   4) All materials furnished by the author have been checked for damage.
      If you receive a disk which HAS been damaged, RETURN the damaged
      disk for an immediate replacement.

      REGISTRATION
      ------------

   5) In paying the registration fee for a file and/or file collection, you 
      are licensing that file and/or file collection for YOUR OWN PERSONAL
      USE for as long as you do NOT violate the following conditions.

      a) You are free to make copies for your own personal use or for
         archival storage purposes.
      b) You may NOT rent, lend or give a registered file and/or file
         collection to anyone who is NOT a registered owner of the same
         file and/or file collection.
      c) You may NOT place a registered file and/or file collection on a
         Bulletin Board Service (BBS).
      d) You AGREE to pay the author for any damages which may occur due
         to your voluntary or involuntary violation of these conditions.
      e) You agree to abide by any additional registration terms set
         forth in any file and/or file collections documentation.

      Violation of your registration agreement will result in the instant
      revocation of ANY and ALL registration agreements you may have made
      with the author. You will NOT be eligible for ANY future updates OR
      registrations for ANY file and/or file collection by the author.

      It is up to you to uphold this agreement !

      UPGRADES
      --------

   6) Registered users in good standing will receive notification of updates
      as they become available. 

      All update forms have an option to NOT order the update, but to remain
      on the update mailing list. If you do not return an update form AT ALL,
      your name will be removed from the mailing list. You will STILL be
      eligible for updates. You won't, however, receive notification of them.

   7) By sending in an update and/or registration form you are stating that
      you have read, understood and completely agree with the terms set forth
      in this file/document and agree to abide by them.


                             A WORD FROM THE AUTHOR
                             ----------------------
                        (or what does all of this mean?)

   As program versions develop, so usually do their features. A program with
   a few features which was available several years ago for, say, $5.00, may
   now have many features and have a current registration fee of say, $15.00.

   To try and avoid the cost and delay of correspondence in bringing an
   interested party up to date, this file was created. If you have obtained
   a file and/or file collection which is fairly old, you should definitely
   send for a current list of titles, versions, terms and fees.

   This will ensure that the title you are sending for is still available
   and that the update/registration materials you are submitting are current
   and correct.

   With only a couple of exceptions, registration fees have remained the same
   for the past couple of years. The one notable increase was a materials/
   shipping/handling fee which was the direct result of the lack of Shareware
   support.

   After I switched to DEMOS, registrations increased. I realize it's a
   bit inconvenient at times to have to "order" a file, but there was
   ample evidence of piracy and this seemed the appropriate response.
   My apologies to all of you HONEST Shareware supporters out there and
   my sincerest THANKS for your continued support !
