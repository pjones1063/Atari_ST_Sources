   The UNCLEMOUSE column specifies whether or not a file supports the
   UncleMouse CURsor file format. This option allows you to use user defined
   cursors within that file.

  It is probably best to obtain a copy of a program from your local BBS or
  Shareware distributor before sending for a title to ensure that the program
  is what you expect. It will also ensure that the program will work properly
  on your system.

  Unless already or otherwise stated, please enclose an extra...

   $3.50   (United States & Canada)
   $4.50   (other)

  for materials, shipping and handling when ordering a program. PLEASE be
  CERTAIN to CONVERT foreign currency to U.S. Dollars ! Sorry, but NO
  personal checks on orders outside of the United States.

  FOREIGN ORDERS
  --------------
  If it is difficult for you to obtain U.S. funds, PLEASE feel free to
  contact me with alternate proposals. ALL inquiries are welcome !

  EXTRAS
  ------
  Please mention on your registration form the types of archive files you
  are able to extract (.LZH -lh0-, -lh1-, -lh5-, .ARC, .ZOO, .ZIP, etc...).
  This will allow me to fit MORE "freebees" on your disk !

  DISKS
  -----
  Unless otherwise requested, ALL disks are DS/DD (809,984 bytes).

                  ATTENTION SHAREWARE/PD SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTORS
                  --------------------------------------------
  If you are distributing my files in an uncompressed state, you are free to
  maximize disk space by including only one copy of OTHERTTL.TXT and one copy
  of NEWTERMS.TXT per disk AS LONG AS my files are the ONLY files on the disk.

  If you are including other peoples files on the SAME disk as any of my files
  the original distribution terms specified with each file or file collection
  remain intact. That is, each file must contain a copy of OTHERTTL.TXT and
  NEWTERMS.TXT.

  ABOUT SHAREWARE
  ---------------
  SHAREWARE software is NOT free ! SHAREWARE authors retain ALL rights to
  their software under the Federal and International Copyright Laws and allow
  distribution of their programs with minimum restrictions. With SHAREWARE
  software you are being given the opportunity to "test drive" the software
  before deciding whether or not to purchase it.

  If you decide to keep and use the software, you are expected to register 
  your copy of the program. Continuing to use a SHAREWARE program without
  paying for it constitutes theft and piracy. 

  The loss of support due to theft and/or piracy only makes it harder for the
  SHAREWARE author to support their program. In such a case the author can
  either abandon the program or distribute it through a CORPORATE middleman at
  at COMMERCIAL PRICES. Please don't let it come to that !

  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*

  SUPPORT
  -------
  My budget requires that ALL Shareware endeavors support themselves. Due to
  a lack of Shareware support, I can no longer afford to maintain a constant
  on-line vigil. I will therefore ONLY be going "on-line" about once every 6
  months (to keep the accounts active). My apologies to anyone who has sent  
  E.MAIL and has not received a response.

  It would also be GREATLY appreciated if any inquiries sent through the Post
  Office (as opposed to E.MAIL) be accompanied by a SASE if a response is
  requested. I don't want to sound mean...I simply can't afford to be pulling
  money out of anywhere else.

  If you HAVE sent in a donation or are a registered user of ANY of my
  programs, you needn't send a SASE. Your donations are used, in part, to
  cover the cost of correspondence.

  I don't believe it's fair to use the donations sent by honest supporters to
  reply to people who are NOT supportive.

     Thanks again for your help !

                  Carl
