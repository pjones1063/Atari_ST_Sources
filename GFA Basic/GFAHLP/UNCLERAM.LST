' After compiling you must rename it as ACC as the compiler automatically
' names it PRG. An ACCessory IS a program with a few variations
' This file can be saved as a GFA file, compiled and installed as a DA.
' Removing my comments before compiling will reduce the amount of memory
' the DA uses when installed.

' Reserve 1000 bytes for D.A. ,otherwise D.A. claims ALL free memory

' declare as a GEM application and get application ID (ap_id&)
ap_id&=APPL_INIT()
' if it's not an ACC (ap_id&=0), ie: if you run it as a program...
IF ap_id&=0

' MALLOC (Memory ALLOCation) reserves blocks of memory.
' MALLOC(x)  If x=-1 it will return the size of the greatest
'            unallocated memory area.
' STR$ changes the value  x  into the corresponding character string.
