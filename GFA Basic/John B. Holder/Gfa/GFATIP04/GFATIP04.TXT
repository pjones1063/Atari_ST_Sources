     Welcome to the fourth in the planned series of GFA TIP files 
by this author.

This archive will contain the following files:

                    GFATIP04.TXT This doc file
                   GFATIP04.PRG Compiled source
             GFATIP04.BAS GFA Basic Source Code file

About the Tip File:

     In this file you will learn how to construct a rudimentary 
two column directory listing that is paged on demand.  It will 
support and list up to 1,000 files contained in the current 
directory.  Files are sorted by means of a quick Shell Sort 
routine.  The Shell sort was chosen since it is relatively easy to 
understand and is suitably fast for sorting arrays of this size.  
Most disk directories will not exceed 1 page.  Files are listed in 
the following format:

         Normal Files contained in the current directory

      Directories - denoted by an asterisk before their name
                         (Ex. *MYDIR.DIR)

  Lastly a text line will be displayed showing vital disk stats.



     Also included in this file is a technique to get vital disk 
statistics and display them within a running program.  While not 
intended to be a 'Power User' demonstration, this Tip File will 
display the benefits to be derived from sorting information and at 
the same time it will show you an alternative to the GFA Basic 
command, "FILES".

     I hope that you get some benefit from the source code and 
concepts contained therein.
