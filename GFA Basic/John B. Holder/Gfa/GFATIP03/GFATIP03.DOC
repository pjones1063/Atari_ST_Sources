     This is the third in a series of planned GFA Basic tip files.  
It seemed that several people had been experiencing some trouble 
with handling errors, so I felt it best to demonstrate with a 
couple of source files in .BAS and .PRG form.

     Pointers on using the Compiler:

     1. If you want to use the Resume Next option, always select 
the following options:

     A. Stop   - Ever
     B. Trapv  - +
     C. Errors - Text
     D. Bombs  - +
     
     By doing so, you will invoke all of the compiler's error 
trapping capabilities.  If you would like to later experiment with 
deleting some of the options, do so with caution.  This is the 
most protected mode available with the compiler.

     2. If you choose to use a Label: to return to, no special 
options are necessary.  Since this reduces the size of the overall 
program, it may be the method of choice.  However, you may need to 
set up Local error trapping routines for each major I/O procedure.


     I know that this Tip File is a bit scanty, but I am working 
Full Bore on an RCS for GFA Basic at the moment and time precluded 
a more wordy, and example filled Doc File.

     Sure hope this helps those who have been experiencing 
problems with Error Trapping with the Compiler.
