
          LANDSCAPE  Designer is a fascinating program written  in 
     GFA Basic which draws three dimensional landscapes similar to 
     those used in that classic strategy game 'The Sentinel',  but 
     it also includes water so that islands can be created.

          The program works by starting off with a flat plane  and 
     then creating fault lines - like earthquakes - on that plane. 
     Everything  to  one  side  of the fault  line  mives  up  and 
     everything to the other side moves down.

          With  very few fault lines the landscape  created  looks 
     similar to a crumpled piece of paper,  but as more are  added 
     it takes on the appearence of a rugged mountain range.

          The  program  draws  a number of such  planes  and  then 
     superimposes them to form the final landscape - this is  done 
     to give it a more random appearence.  The water level can  be 
     changed  once the landscape is drawn and the effect of  tides 
     can be seen.

          This  allows the same landscape to be either a  mountain 
     range on a plain, a set of volcanic islands rising out of the 
     sea or just one rocky peak sticking out of the water.

          Landscape Designer is menu-driven, and very easy to use. 
     The  values  typed  into the program are  not  bound  by  any 
     limits,  so  anything  can  be enteredto  see  the  resulting 
     landscape.

          You  can set the grid size - the size of the  landscape, 
     the  number of fault lines and the water  level.  Entering  a 
     negative grid size will produce some very strange effects  on 
     screen,  but  you can enter a negative water level to  reduce 
     its height.
