================================================================
                                                                                                
GFA-DRAFT 3.2      

Powerful  and  comprehensive,  yet easy to use CAD  software  for 
Atari ST/STE and Atari TT.  Runs in both high and medium  resolu-
tions.  Icon and menu driven commands. There are symbol libraries 
for  electrical,  electronic users and architects.  Libraries  of 
symbols are also easy to create. 

A  program/macro interface (using GFA BASIC) will enable  you  to 
create complex forms and repetive patterns.  Exports:  HPGL,  DXF 
and  GEM  files.  Will  support almost any model  of  printer  or 
plotter.  GFA-Draft  Plus  3.2  also  supports  the  Atari  laser 
printer.

================================================================

GFA-Basic 3.6 Interpreter

Very powerful and fast interpreter for Atari ST/STE and Atari TT. 
Considered to be the fastest Basic interpreter available for  the 
Atari.  The  fast  editor  checks the  syntax  of  commands  when 
entered, (ideal for begginers) and avoids mistyped variable names 
by advising the user that a new variable has been declared.  Many 
features  of C and Pascal are also included.  

Supports the GEM AES and VDI directly. All BIOS, XBIOS and GEMDOS 
commands are also supported. 

Supported  by large user group and large public  domain  library. 
GFA-Basis is also supported by several tutorial programming books 
for all levels of users.
 
GFA-Basic  is also syntax compatible with GFA-BASIC  Amiga,  GFA-
BASIC  MS-DOS and GFA-BASIC Windows 3.0 versions,  allowing  your 
software  to  be  ported  to and from the  Atari  to  many  other 
environments.

Development  time and learning time is drastically  reduced  when 
using an interpreter, rather than a compiler. When development is 
complete then you can take advantage of the speed of a  compiler, 
by compiling the interprer code with the GFA-Basic Compiler.


================================================================

GFA-Basic 3.6 Compiler

Creates   faster   compact  stand  alone  code   from   GFA-BASIC 
Interpreter  code.  Easily creates desk top  accessories.  Allows 
programmer  to  merge  assembler  and  C  source  with  GFA-BASIC 
programs.  Object code can be produced to run in either ST or  TT 
ram.

================================================================

GFA-Assembler 1.51

An integrated development tool for the Atari  ST/STE,  comprising 
editor,  macro assembler,  linker and debugger. Supports multiple 
window,  file compare,  background assembly. Editor checks syntax 
of  machine  code on entry,  hence ideal for programmers  new  to 
assembly language. Also creates files that can be loaded directly 
into GFA-BASIC.

================================================================

GFA G-Shell

Professional  development  shell for  GFA-BASIC  Interpreter  and 
Compiler  on the Atari ST/STE and TT.  Allows programmer to  skip 
between Interpreter and Compiler.  Supports make facility and  on 
line help files.

================================================================


GFA GEM Utility Pack

A  set of GFA-BASIC 3.6 routines to support the features  of  GEM 
that allow you to easily create window, menu and dialog box based 
applications  on  the Atari ST/STE.  All  GFA-BASIC  source  code 
supplied  and documented to enable you to see how to  create  GEM 
based applications.

================================================================


GFA-Advanced Programming Book and Disk

This  book covers in great detail the following aspects  in  GFA-
BASIC 3.5 programming:  Line A,  Debugging,  AES, GDOS, Assembler 
interface on the Atari ST/STE.

================================================================

GFA-Basic and Assembler User Book

This  book covers all that you will need to know  in  interfacing 
assembler routines into GFA-BASIC on the Atari  ST/STE.  Includes 
an introduction into assembly programming,  creation of desk  top 
accessories, graphic manipulation. Book (364 pages) plus disk


================================================================

GFA-Mission Control

A program launcher and chainer for the Atari ST/STE. This utility 
will enable you to launch most programs with predefined start and 
load sequence.  Termination of program can also result in automa-
tic load of next program with parameter passing between  applica-
tions.
