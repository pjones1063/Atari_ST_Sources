PLEASE READ THIS FILE.
    
Don't you just hate 80 column
text files with a low rez prg!? 
(Tee Hee)

Well this started out as version 3.1 or 3.2, but by the time I was 
finished, the program looked and acted so differently, that it 
warranted a full revision number. This is also the LAST version I plan 
to release. After over 2 years since the first (Sorry 1.5) release, I 
figure I need a new project. It's also the first time that I can say 
that I am really happy with the program's look, feel and intelligence.

This release of SORRY also marks the first time I will be 
distributing it in the U.K. (where I hope it finds it's way 
throughout Europe. After all, the ST is much more popular there than 
here at home!)

By the way, I have no programming experience to speak of, and SORRY 
is a testament to the power of GFA BASIC, and ofcourse the Atari ST 
itself. It may be suffering from lack of marketing prowess on the 
part of it's management, but the ST is the ULTIMATE home computer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

One more thing before I get on to actual changes, although none of 
the various revisions of this program have ever been intended as 
anything but FREEware (in otherwords this is my gift to you and I 
don't expect or request any monetary compensation), I would like to 
ask that the money that you would normally send as a shareware fee be 
donated instead to your local AIDS charity. To register SORRY, just 
send me a copy of your donation receipt and a short note. You'll find 
my current address(as well as other trivia) by clicking on the "INFO"
button at any time during the game...

                          ======================
                          CHANGES IN VERSION 4.0
                          ======================

Before I discuss any other changes, let's get the new disk set-up out 
of the way...

Sorry now includes 66 data files.(this may seem excessive, but it was 
the only way to guarantee that it would continue to run on a 1/2 meg 
machine, and continue it's tradition of commercial quality graphics.)
So let's get organized...

  ANY FILE WITHOUT A 3 LETTER EXTENSION, MUST BE PLACED IN A FOLDER 
     CALLED "DATA". SORRY40.PRG MUST REMAIN OUTSIDE THIS FOLDER!

It could have been worse...I could have created a seperate folder for 
every different TYPE of data file, but not even I am THAT organized!

You can do whatever you like with SORRY.DOC and WHATSNEW.TXT, but 
please, if you plan on distributing this program (please do!),
don't delete them!! If you have a 360k drive, you'll have to format it
80 tracks/10 sectors  minimum to fit all the files.

And now the fun stuff...

-The computer player strategy is now improved (They can be 
 down right nasty!!). The computer SHOULD no longer make seemingly 
 silly moves, and when caculating the possible moves of a SEVEN, ELEVEN, 
 or SORRY, it will now pay closer attention to what's happening in 
 the game.(The computer will now sometimes not make the best choice 
 for his own position, but will instead opt on curtailing an 
 opponent.) I hope you find that this makes for a better "intelligence" 
 simulation. Remember though that this is a "home-made" game and is 
 still not perfect.

-The loading sequence has been completely re-written, and now allows 
 you to optionally load instructions. (Check 'em out at least once.)

-The exit-from-demo routine has been made more efficient. When you 
 hit a key, the computer player will finish it's turn (only fair) and 
 the Playmode Selector will re-appear. If it doesn't work, maybe the 
 computer is really enjoying the game!

-There is now an "INFO" button on the SELECT-O-MATIC. This will 
 suspend the game and display a series of "Credits" cards. It's 
 basically ego-speak stuff, as well as the "Share"ware information.
 (in quotation marks, because as I said earlier this is really FREEware) 
 Your turn resumes after the credits.
 On a half-meg machine these cards will load from disk when the INFO 
 button is clicked.

-There is now no disk access between games. Infact if you have more 
 than 520k, the drive should never access after the game has started.
 (If it does you may have something to worry about!)

-The EXIT sequence has been re-written. The Anti-Piracy message is 
 still there...it's something that I, and THE GRAND HOTEL BBS, believe in.

-Oh ya, the name has been changed. This is now "ST SORRY" and not 
 "Computer Sorry". I was in a software store the other day, and saw 
 an official release of Computer Sorry (actually it was awful!), and 
 decided that Parker Brothers have been so nice in not taking legal 
 action against this software, that I'd better not press my luck. 
 Anyway, I have no intention of ever writing this for any other 
 platform, so let's call a rose a rose.(or an ST an ST)

In closing, I would just like to once again thank Shiraz for his 
code. As I said earlier, I am not a programmer (in fact I AM a 
shoe salesman), and his exquisite algorythms taught me more about 
mathematical equations than all my years of school. As I edited his 
code for the enhanced intelligence, my previous code began to look more 
and more contrived and simplistic. Quite simply, this game would never
have made it to this version without him.

Ofcourse this game would never have made it to this version without 
you! Your support and kind words have been wonderful. As for those of 
you who have not written to me, or called the BBS, hop to it! It only costs 
you a stamp to write a few words... What board game translation would 
you like to see next?...Where are you from?...What do you think of 
the game?...What do you think of Star Trek (TOS,TNG and/or 
DS9)?...Anything, just let me know who you are!

                          ======================
                          CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0
                          ======================

-One Player mode is now active! Special thanks goes out to Shiraz 
 Baboo, a true friend, who wrote the computer player routines as a 
 Christmas present. (Actually he was just sick of waiting for me to 
 get off my butt and write it myself!)

-You may play multiple human players against multiple computer 
 players (to a maximum of 4 players total ofcourse!), or if you 
 prefer to sit back and watch, a demo mode is available.. A new
 Playmode Selector button-box has been added to make your choices
 fairly simple.

-The bug that did not allow floppy users to load the game under TOS 
 1.04 has been fixed. Sorry about any stress this may have caused, 
 but I use a hard drive and didn't realize this problem existed until 
 recently.

-You may now quit anytime the mouse is active by clicking on the "X"
 button in the upper right hand corner of the 'SELECT-O-MATIC'

-You may now optionally select any move by clicking directly on the 
 tokens in play instead of using the 'SELECT-O-MATIC'.

-The source code is no longer available by request. To those of you 
 who expressed an interest, I'm sorry, but there's just to much hard 
 work and love that went into this project to have strangers hacking 
 around with the program.

-Please do not write to the address in previous versions of the game 
 as it has not been current for quite some time. You may contact me 
 via The Grand Hotel BBS at (416) 491-0370. 


Thanks for all your past support and patience in awaiting this long 
overdue upgrade. I promise the next version, with improved computer 
strategy (and personality) will be along much more quickly!
