You will be asked to input an energy Turn value, which is the 
amount of energy each bug loses per cycle. The higher the value, 
the faster the Bugs will starve. Secondly you are asked how many 
Bug groups you would like. Each group is represented by a 
different colour. Thirdly input the number of Bugs in each 
group. A low number is opreferable, as higher numbers will slow 
the program. You are then asked how many Bugs you want to 
define. Enter zero, and the program will generate all of the 
Bugs for you.

During the simulation, the following keys are available:

   R - Displays a report on the first 20 bugs in detail. Press 
RETURN to cycle through the bugs. The values at the bottom can 
be noted and used as input to another game - thus you can keep 
details of the strongest bugs.
   S - Shows statistics for all the bugs in each group. Again 
use teh RETURN key to cycle through the Bugs.
   C - This key toggles the Screen update, and can be used to 
speed up the program where there are many bugs alive.
   T - The Turbo option can be used when only one group is left, 
and speeds up the program by disabling the part which checks for 
bugs eating one another.
   SPACE - Ends the program and returns to the Desktop.
   F - Causes a Famine by stopping the addition of food.
   N - Sets the food level production to normal.
   P - Increases food production by a factor of 0.4.

   To get the best out of Bugs, it is usually better to have 
many groups with few members, and with experience, you should be 
able to design superbugs.


Bugs is a simulation of life taken a step further than the 
normal LIFE programs (an example of which is also included on 
this months cover disk). The left of the screen shows a graphic 
representation of the Bugs in their struggle. On the right, a 
list of figures shows Group Number, Energy, Reproduction Energy 
and generation Number respectively.

   The simulation sets up groups of bugs which have the same 
characteristics, or genes, and leaves them to survive in the 
snmall world on the left of the screen by moving, reproducing 
and eatin (either food or other bugs from different groups)

   Each Bug has 15 properties in its genes which determines how 
it lives its life. At the start of the sinmulation, food is 
scattered over the world indicated by the yellow dots. Foods 
value varies between 1 and 10. More food is scattered every 
cycle, unless you have started a famine.

   The Bugs move each cycle, their movement dependant on two of 
their "genes". If a Bug hits a food particle, it will eat it and 
the energy will be added to the Bugs energy. The Bugs lose a 
certain amount of energy every cycle, and their age increases.

   Death can occur in three ways. Starvation, Old Age or by 
being eaten. When two Bugs meet, only the one with the higher 
energy survives - the winner gains half of the energy of the 
dead Bug.

   The Bugs also reproduce. When they are old enough, andf have 
sufficient energy, the Bug will have two offspring. One will be 
genetically identical to its parent. The other will have a 
slightly altered gene set, representing natural mutation. This 
allows a crude form of natural selection, as only a beneficial 
mutation should lead to survival long enough for that Bug to 
reproduce.
