     This program is very easy to use. It will install itself the first
time it's launched, just choose the language (French or English) and then
select the folder where the SIMPLEX.PRG is located. That's all!!!

     You are now ready to process files.

     Just select one of the 2 buttons in the "SimpleX Archiver" Action
window and select the file, folder or archive you want to process.
SimpleX is quite intelligent, if you'v selected the COMPRESS button and
you select a file then this file only will be compressed. If you select
a folder then the complete folder will be compressed. You can also
select a folder and enter a file mask to compress only the files you want.
If you'v selected the EXTRACT button you just have to choose an archive
in any of the following format; ARC, LZH, ZIP or ZOO and SimpleX will
extract the files from the archive.

     If you are under Geneva¿ or Multi-TOS their designated utility
will be used to run the TTPs. (This option can be disabled...)

     When you are in DUMMIES MODE, SimpleX will also show you the location
of the file you'v just processed.

     Install SimpleX as an application and when you double click on an
archive SimpleX will extract the files and return you to de Desktop. You
can also drag an item from the desktop and drop it on SimpleX for immediate
processing. If you drop a file, SimpleX will compress the file using the
default compression type (this default type can be changed from the ACTION
menu). If you drop a folder on SimpleX, the entire content of the folder
will be compressed. If you drop an archive on SimpleX, the files will be
extracted...

     SimpleX is only a Shell, to accomplish the actual processing of the
archive, SimpleX use TTP programs. Those programs are from other programmers
and you should be greatefull to them for what they did. Unfortunatly
processing archives can be a teadious task when using stand alone TTPs...
But all this waste of time is a thing of the past with SimpleX!

     I hope you enjoy this program!
     Be seeing you.

**** Thanks to Dan Wigla for the help on using the SHELL WRITE AES function.
     (We'v discovered a bug in GFA 3.07 when using the GFA's SHEL_WRITE
      call...do not use it, call the AES directly using GEMSYS 121)


**** Pay your Shareware fee to the TTP programmers...
