ST-Keep Update News
-------------------

06Sep92

If you are running ST-Keep from a program that doesn't allow ST-Keep
to answer the phone (as a door, from Binkley, etc.) you will need to
pass the switch "-L" for LOCAL along the command line with the baud
rate and/or path to use.  Update of your autoexec.bat files to spawn
ST-Keep will be required.  This ensures better carrier loss detection
when run if the user hangs up during the boot process.  Previously,
the time between the door program starting ST-Keep and ST-Keep
checking for carrier left about 2 seconds of possible error in
detection, now the -L ensures a valid detection at all times.

Some of you may have been having problems with the door menu showing
up under [*] or [.][e][d]... be sure to use BBS_CNFG.PRG and under
the [A][X] option (second menu) where the door execs are configured,
select "0" for any door information that is unused (auto-exec, logon,
logoff).  If it is a blank line you will end up with problems getting
to your menu, although [*] would still auto-run your selected door.

30Aug92

Screen length ...More? prompting is now disabled during an extended
directory listing.

Auto-goto next floor flag has been added.  Under [X][N][K] (edit
configuration, system options, auto-goto...) the user may turn the
feature on or off that automagically takes them to the next floor if
they have pressed [G]oto and are done with the rooms on the current
floor.

Added user toggle to turn "Rooms with new messages list" on/off when
moving among floors.  [L] under user config, system options.

If a [S]kip is performed on the last room on a floor, it will act
just as if it was a [G]oto and attempt to move to the next floor if
the proper user flags are set (it still won't mark the messages as
read).

27Aug92

Logon exec and logoff exec have been changed along with bbs_cnfg.prg.
You will be required to enter a door number for each of these execs
and the command line is now invalid.  Instead, create a door with
group status that will allow your users to run the desired door as
if they chose it themselves.  Run cnfg.prg to edit those door numbers
as they were previously paths.  You may want to use this to have
ST-Keep run Fidodoor automatically when a user logs on and check their
netmail, etc.  If any of these doors are unused, you MUST use a "0"
for the door number, if you leave it as a null string you won't be
able to get your door menu.

*** SPECIAL BULLETIN ***

This will be the last shareware update of ST-Keep.  I am working on
v5.00 which will be commercial and will sell for a higher rate than
the current $25 shareware fee.  Updates to v5.00 should be around $10
for current registered SysOps, but don't hold me to that.

The ONLY changes I will make to v4.99 will be bug fixes, so make sure
and let me know of any that you may stumble into.  Any suggestions
for new functions or features will be added to the new commercial
version and require you to upgrade if you want to see them.

I would like to extend my appreciation for all the current registered
SysOps, if it wasn't for you, ST-Keep wouldn't be the BBS that it is
now (I couldn't have thought of all this stuff myself!)

Since ST-Keep will be a commercial product, I will not be able to
offer the common daily changes I made up to this point.  You probably
won't be seeing update notices more than once a month anymore.

Thanks again for all your support, see ya on the nets!

*** BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAM ***

26Aug92

Carrier loss is now detected when run as a door and the loss happened
before the BBS was fully loaded.

16Aug92

If any files are on hold, they can now be downloaded in
'undownloadable' rooms.  Previously, the no-dl status of a room would
not allow a [D] request and thus nullify the held file download and
require the user to move to a directory / dl room in order to proceed.

If chat mode is disabled, the user is not notified twice that the
sysop is unavailable.  NOCHAT.BLB is ONLY used if the sysop doesn't
answer the chat, but if it's disabled a simple message will be sent
to the user.

08Aug92

A second menu has been added in the configuration editor
(BBS_CNFG.PRG) to facilitate the addition of new paths to locate.
Run it and familiarize yourself by pressing [A] to change paths, then
[X] to go to the 2nd menu where you can enter some new options, most
importantly the name and location of your chat program.

ST-Keep's chat mode has been removed and written as an external
module.  You will need the BBS_CHAT.PRG along with the new version of
BBS.PRG otherwise you won't be able to chat!

You MUST locate your CHAT EXEC using the configuration editor by
editing your paths and then going to the 2nd menu by pressing [X].
Simply enter the drive/path/filename spec you wish to invoke when
chat mode is called.  This would read "C:\BBS\BBS_CHAT.PRG" or
something like that for ST-Keep's chat, otherwise you can have it
call your own chat programs.

07Aug92

All the UNUSED lines in INFA.SYS are now used!  These can be updated
by using the new version of BBS_CNFG.PRG.

Line 7 is now for the chat exec filename.  This is the path and
filename to run when you select chat mode with a user.  ST-Keeps chat
mode is now external (BBS_CHAT.PRG).  You can choose your own chat
program simply by using its name instead.

Line 17 is the logon exec filename.  This program will run after a
user logs on.

Line 18 is the logon exec's command line information.

Line 19 is the door number to run (auto-door) when [*] is pressed from
any room prompt.  This will automatically run this door (from
STK_DOOR.SYS) when pressed.  The [.][E][D] command will still bring up
the old menu.  The best use for this feature is to allow your users to
press [*] and it'll autorun DIP!

05Aug92

Fixed file directory listing so it would no longer ad directory ".",
".", and "FILES" to the total file count when displaying that
information.  Some users were complaining that they couldn't see 3
files!

01Aug92

Added auto-goto next floor.

17Jul92

In the message editor, if you go to the edit command and later
continue your message, it would place a CR at the last position in
the editor.  This no longer happens so when continuing, you'll start
exactly where you left off before pressing RETURN twice to get to the
edit command.

Increased rs232 i/o buffers to 4K each if the port is locked.

13Jul92

Bug fix, new messages read weren't always getting updated properly in
the version during the past 4 days.

Update to BBS_TERM to ensure that the menu bar gets re-displayed
properly when returning from terminal mode.

12Jul92

BBS_CNFG.PRG has been updated to reflect the use of 192 to lock the
port at 19.2K rather than 0 which will simply allow calls up to 19.2K
but setting the port at the modem speed rather than locking it at
19.2K.

08Jul92

Added a post logon exec command.  Line #19 in the STK_INFA.SYS file
can contain a pathname and program name (i.e. "D:\FIDO\FIDODOOR.TTP")
which will run right after the system prints "Welcome, Username!"
after a logon.

04Jul92

Something happened to my updated BBS_NEWS.DOC file so this information
might not have been in the last update as of 01Jul92...

There is a new function to disallow new users access to the BBS totally.
They can only apply for an account and then they will be logged off (as
well as if they call back).  The SysOp will need to upgrade their access
level to allow them on.  This will disallow new users from attributing to
ANY system activity other than one new call and an application, which
constitutes a new access level even tighter than level 1 was before.  To
toggle this "Limit New User" function, use the Co-SysOp Option menu "K"
([.][C][O][K]).  This also required changes to the access level formats,
so prepare for a bit of work.

New Access Levels:

       0 = killed or unused account (same)
       1 = Limited New User (new, application only, no further logon)
       2 = Unvalidated User (now write/file xfer/door privs,
                             previously level 1)
       3 = Validated user (write/file xfer/door privs,
                           previously level 2)
   4- 99 = Normal users for SysOp configuration
 100-149 = Aide
 150-199 = Co-SysOp
 200-254 = SysOp
     255 = Supervisor

This means that you will *MUST* to change the access level of your current
users by using the mass userlog editor (good practice!).  On my system,
level 5 is SST Members, 4 is special users, 3 is unused, 2 is validated
users and 1 is unvalidated users.  I basically need to insert a new level
between 0 and 1, so I'll move level 2 to 3 (since 3 is unused), 1 to 2,
and leave 1 open for the new level if it needs to be used.  Since 4 and 5
aren't being bumped, they don't need to be changed.  Of course, you will
need to change level 2 to 3 first and then 1 to 2 so that I don't create a
ton of level 2 users first and then move them all to level 3.  Always
start converting from the highest level first.  It is critical that you
change levels, otherwise certain users will not be able to use the system
as validated users.

31Jun92

Terminal mode now calls BBS_TERM.PRG (my own creation) rather than using
an internal dumb-terminal procedure.  Hopefully BBS_TERM will grow as time
goes on.  Place this program in your system directory.

Added [A] Access Desk Accessories from the wait call screen.

Added [B] Baud Rate change from the wait call screen.  This will save the
new rate to INFA.SYS so it'll be your new maximum baud rate default (or
port locking information).

Cosmetics.

01Jun92

Added [H]old file function.  User must use [D]ownload from within any
room to download all held files.  If these files are not downloaded by the
user before the session ends, the list will be erased upon call
termination.

Changes made to the file description format.

TOS version reporting fixed.

24May92

I re-wrote the output routines so that it prints one word at a time rather
than a whole line at a time.  You will notice a definate decrease in
console output during local logons, but users will have more immediate
response to their stop and pause requests when reading messages.

11May92

Fixed bug whereby the BBS would bomb if you tried to move a file from a
directory room to another directory room which didn't have a folder
created on disk.

Added 2 characters to each room name when listed within [K]nown rooms
command.

10May92

Moved Debug function to [.][C][D]ebug so that normal users can't access it
via the old CTRL-P command.  Oldmsg% should = oldest msg on disk.

Fixed [1] directory command so that a room with 0 files will not show the
last byte count of a previous directory room.

Added a menu file for USERBOOT.# routines.  When you use [F6] to send a
userboot textfile before bumping a user, USERBOOT.MNU located in your MSG
folder will be displayed so you can remember which boot files you have.

08May92

New BBS config to allow locking the serial port at 19200 bps for high
speed modems.

08Apr92

Instant Graphics and Sound menu's were reportedly not working correctly,
make sure your menu extensions are IGS.  Use BIG for IBM IGS, MNU for
ASCII, ANS for ANSI and V52 for VT-52.

30Mar92

A new pathname option has been added so that the SysOp can designate where
ST-Keep stores it's temporary files.  Line #16 in STK_INFA.SYS contains
this pathname.  It must terminate with a backslash.  This can be a RAMdisk
to enhance the speed of functions requiring temporary files.  You will
need the new version of BBS_CNFG.PRG as well.

ST-Keep's internal backup routines have been removed.  You will need to
set up an EXEC event to run backups.  Simply create a batchfile with your
favorite CLI and have it use your preference of archivers and take care of
your backup.
