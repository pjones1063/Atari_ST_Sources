   So, you want to be a SysOp?
 
   You may make as many copies of this program and its accompanying files
for your personal use as you wish, or otherwise distribute as many copies
of the original STKEEP.LZH file which contains the complete BBS package, as
long as you keep it in its original form including all files and
documentation.  The original archived files are STK_PRG.LZH (the
initialization and main BBS program and utilities), STK_BLB.LZH (menus and
message blurbs), and STK_HLP.LZH (help files).
 
   Inside STK_PRG.LZH, you will find BBS_NEWS.DOC, which will contain any
information that I wasn't able to include in the SysOp or User manual,
please read it carefully.  The addition of functions and features along
with bug fixes will be posted in this file.  Periodically, you will be
requested to modify your system files to allow for compatibility with
future upgrades.
 
   ST-Keep BBS is shareware.  I request that you send a registration fee of
$25.00 along with some information and you will receive on-line support,
bug fixes, and updates from my BBS (or I can send you a disk with the
latest version for a small handling fee, usually disk and postage costs).
You are not required to send this fee, but the registration and support may
come in handy.  If you are not registered, suggestions for added features
or changes made by you and your users may fall on deaf ears.  I strongly
believe in the versatility of this program, and therefore wish to see as
many people using it as possible.  If you wish to send the shareware fee or
an amount you deem appropriate, send a letter and check to:

      Please include your name, address, voice phone number, BBS phone
      number, hours and other pertinent connect information, so that I can
      keep records of registered users.  State in your letter that you are
      registering ST-Keep BBS so I don't assume that you are registering
      any of my other programs.  Make checks payable to Andrew Studer.

   This document file along with any other *.DOC files should be printed
out for easy access, especially the various files that explain the system
commands in detail.  You should also print out the *.HLP files since they
contain helpful information, and you may even wish to print out the *.MNU
files for quick reference.
 
   I can not be held responsible for any damage caused by this program or
information.  I will attempt to keep the program as bug-free as possible.

  Introduction
  ------------

   At first, ST-Keep appears to be a Citadel (room based) type bulletin
board system.  However, once you begin working with it, you will notice
that it takes on a unique appearance of its own along with adding a great
many features not found in Citadel programs.  You may even recognize some
functions or features resembling ATKeep, which was an Atari 8-bit Citadel
BBS that my friend, Brent Barrett, and I wrote in the mid 1980s for our
Atari 800XL's. My love for that program and the lack of any 'professional
and versatile' Citadel prompted me to create ST-Keep for the ST's while
Brent went on to the IBM to create Novucivitas.  Since I had no knowlege of
C, I had to create ST-Keep completely from scratch, as it is written and
compiled in GFA BASIC 3.5e.  The time expended on researching the ST's
operating system and implementing the functions in GFA was not only
time-consuming, but challenging and fun at the same time.
 
Conventions
-----------
 
   Throughout these documents and the BBS program itself, you will see
brackets surrounding single or multiple letters.  This means that to obtain
a particular command, press the key(s) inside the bracket(s).  If you see
"[T] Terminate Connection," it means to press the "T" key on your keyboard
(upper or lowercase) to logoff the BBS.  If you see "[.][E][R] Create
Room," press "." "E" and "R" one after another, and the system will respond
with ".Enter Room:  " and allow you to type in the room name you wish to
create.
 
   At most any time while text or messages are being displayed while on
ST-Keep, just type [CONTROL-S] or [P] to pause the display, then type any
key to resume.  If you would like to abort or stop the display, press
[CONTROL-C] or [S].  Obviously, [P] and [S] are easier to use than the
CONTROL options.  There are certain prompts that can not be stopped due to
the necessity of viewing this information.

   System Requirements
   -------------------
 
   ST-Keep will run with only 512K RAM and a modem.  A hard drive is
strongly suggested.  A RAM disk would be OK, but unreliable unless you made
frequent backups.  A typical system will need less than 1 Megabyte of drive
storage for its system files, and still runs on less than 300K RAM.
Monochrome and Color are supported, along with 9600 baud modems.  If you
don't have much free RAM after installing the system, chances are you won't
be able to run on-line games or doors, so keep this in mind, the more rooms
and user accounts you have, the more RAM the BBS will use.  1 Megabyte of
RAM would be ideal for a system including games and other doors.  Hopefully
these minimum requirements won't change very much in future upgrades,
however, I make no guarantees.  You should include FOLDRXXX.PRG in your
AUTO folder of your hard drive.  This program can increase the folder
buffers that TOS allocates, and since you will have a different folder for
each room, it would be a good idea to increase the buffer size.  You can
also use FILEFIND.TTP and pass it an "x" to find the total number of
folders on your system so that you can rename FOLDRxxx.PRG to a number
slightly higher than your total folder count.
 
 
Installation
------------
 
    You may put ST-Keep and all of its support files anywhere on your hard
drive.  When you are ready to install your board, run BBS_CNFG.PRG from the
drive and folder from where you plan on running BBS.PRG (ST-Keep).  If you
want ST-Keep to run from D:\STK\, initially you will need to run
BBS_CNFG.PRG from that same folder to insure that the system files are in
the correct area.  Run BBS_CNFG.PRG, you will see a menu of options with
defaults.  When you choose each option, you'll be given a description of
the meaning, and then you are asked to make your configuration choice.  You
may have up to 32000 user accounts, 32000 topic rooms or SIG's, 32000
messages per room, 255 floors, and 15 groups.  You will need to configure
your system for your needs, so think your plans out carefully.  Obviously,
if you used a very large configuration, these numbers would tend to degrade
the speed of various system functions, so a standard setup might be as per
the defaults in your menu options (200 users, 60 rooms, and 75 messages per
room).
 
   All messages are stored in one 'circular' file that is referenced by
pointers for each message in the rooms.  This file is usually created at
200-500K.  I have seen very active boards with only a 300K message file,
and messages stick around long enough for regular callers.  If your system
is configured to allow 50 messages per room, with 100 rooms, and a 300K
message base, you would expect around 500 to 2000 messages active on your
system at any time.  When you enter the size of your message base, enter it
in total bytes.  That is, if you want a 300K message base, just type in
307200 (300*1024).  I don't suggest using more than 100 messages per room
or your new users would get very tired reading all the messages in each
topic.
 
      NOTE:  Messages are deleted based on 4 criteria:  first is when the
      message base file fills up, the pointers start back at the beginning
      of the file and start deleting the oldest messages in the system;
      second is when a user enters the maximum message number allowed in
      the room, the oldest message in that room is deleted; third is when
      the aide command is used to delete a message; and fourth is when
      users delete their own messages.
 
   Once you finish changing all the options to suit your needs, use [S]ave
and the program will begin initializing your system files.  NOTE:  These
system files must always be in this directory, along with BBS.PRG.  When it
is finished, run BBS.PRG and your system is ready to accept the first
caller or local logon.
 
   You must include XYZ.TTP in the folder you create for the file transfer
shell option or in the system directory if you don't change it.  Alan
Hamilton has the best protocol features and these are what ST-Keep uses for
file transfers.  Please send him a shareware donation if your system uses
file transfers.
 
   Your favorite archive utility (i.e. ARC.TTP, LHARC.TTP, etc...) should
be in this directory also if you are using the archival backup feature.
  
Co-SysOp Commands - [.][C][?]
-----------------------------

The Co-SysOp commands are used to manage ST-Keep's functions and features
by the SysOp and any designate Co-SysOps.  These commands may be accessed
on-line (either via local log-on or distant, through the modem) by pressing
a sequence of three keys: the period, the letter "C", and one of the
following (depending on the desired function):
 
[A] Access User
    Allows editing of the current user via the local keyboard.  The system
    password is requested before editing can begin.
 
[B] Backup Option
    Press [RETURN] to disable the backup option.  Otherwise enter a valid
    drive and pathname (i.e. "C:\FOLDER\") where ST-Keep will backup all
    the *.SYS files when the first caller after midnight logs off.  You
    must insure that you have enough space on the backup partition, so just
    calculate it by adding the size of all the *.SYS files in your system
    directory.  Note, this won't work on a floppy unless all your system
    files are less than 720K.  If you have the compression backup enabled,
    the files will be compressed into a single file named for the current
    date (i.e.  "10_25_91.LZH").
 
[C] Chat Mode Toggle
    Toggle to disable or enable chat mode ringer.  If chat mode is
    disabled, NOCHAT.BLB will be shown to the user.
 
[D] Disable BBS Toggle
    If there is a situation where you wish to disable the BBS from
    accepting any callers but you don't wish to shut your system off, just
    use this command and all calls will be shown DISABLE.BLB and won't be
    allowed to logon unless they know the system password.  After this file
    is show, you can press [CTRL-B] and a "Pw:" prompt will display.  Enter
    your system password and you can get on the BBS as normal.
 
[E] Execute File
    Use the file selector to run any program under ST-Keep; keep in mind
    that you must insure there is enough RAM available for both programs.
    If this command is used from remote, the user must type in the
    drive/path/filename and you must insure they they don't run any
    programs that don't support modem I/O or the system will effectively
    lock-up.
  
[F] Floor Editor
    Edit floor name and floor group access.  New floors can be created by
    using a text editor (like STeno from STrata Software) to add them to
    the STK_FLRS.SYS file in the system folder.  Note that you may have a
    maximum of 255 floors, and that creating more than the number set when
    you ran BBS_CNFG.PRG may cause problems.
  
[G] Group Editor
    Edit group names.  The names themselves are meaningless to ST-Keep,
    but they will help you remember who belongs in which group.
 
[K] Kill User
    Delete a user account.  Effectively changes their ACCESS level to 0,
    freeing up this userlog spot for a new user.  When a new user logs on
    and registers, their information will overwrite the information of the
    first accesse level 0 account found, so even if you have 50 empty slots
    in your user account base at the end, if user number 7 has access level
    0, his/her information will vanish when the next new user registers.
 
[M] Mass Userlog Editor
    This command executes BBS_ME.PRG in your system folder.  You can edit
    all accounts by selected fields with this program, rather than one user
    at a time.  Be careful not to change your own access level below 255
    with the masss editor, or you may not be able to access all functions!

[P] Change System Password
    Change the system password.  This password allows access to any user
    account and other secure features of the BBS, so protect it with your
    life!
 
[S] Secure System Toggle
    Make your system secure or open.  If it's secure, all user accounts are
    installed with access level 1, which means they can not leave messages
    or make file transfers until the SysOp upgrades their level.  If your
    system is open, new users are given access level 2 and the default
    on-line time and download ratio that you entered with the
    initialization program.
 
[U] Userlog Editor
    You will be prompted for a username to edit.  Most of the user's data
    can be modified with this command.  You can even print out the user
    information from here.  This command only works on an account in the
    disk file, not the current user on-line.
 
[Z] Change Modem Init String
    You can set your modem initialization string with this command.  The
    initialization string is sent out during the waitcall menu.  The start
    up string MUST contain "AT S0=1 S2=255 M0" at the very least.  These
    commands place your modem in auto-answer mode, refuse remote modem
    command access, and turn your modem speaker off respectively.  ST-Keep
    handles DTR and CARRIER DETECT, so do not force them on your modem.  If
    you have special high speed modems or modems with other features, you
    can attempt to include more options here if necessary so long as they
    don't interfere with CD or DTR.

Aide Commands
-------------

What is an Aide?  He/She is a designated high-level (and trustworthy!)
user whom you ave chosen to manage some of ST-Keeps' functions (hopefully
to take some of the system maintenance burden from you).  Aide commands
are accessed in a similar manner to the Co-SysOp commands, by pressing the
period, the letter "A", and one of the letters indicated below.  Many Aide
commands have sub-commands, which require a fourth keypress to identify.

[E] Edit Room Status
 
    [A] Roomname
        Change the name of the current room.
 
    [B] Number
        Change the current room slot number, currently disabled.
 
    [C] Generation
        Changes the generation number so that all users lose access 
        to this room (unless they are high level users).  This is
        equivalent to uninviting all users. You should increment this
        number by one up to 254, then re-start again at 2.
 
    [D] Floor
        Change the floor number that the current room is located on.
 
    [E] Status
        Toggle to make the current room public, hidden, or invitation 
        only.  Public rooms can be entered by all users.  Hidden 
        rooms can only be entered by users if they [.][G]"ROOMNAME" 
        using the EXACT room name.  Invitation only rooms can only be 
        entered by users who have been [I]nvited, even if they know the
        exact roomname.
 
    [F] Anonymous
        All messages in this room will show ****** hiding the date, 
        time, and author field.  If a user logs on with the system
        password, the headers will show the actual author.
 
    [G] Archived
        Save all the messages in this room to a specified filename 
        for archival purposes.
 
    [H] Directory
        Add or remove directory status for this room.  The format is 
        "C:\FOLDER\".  The trailing backslash is required.
 
    [I] Uploads
        Toggle to allow or disallow file uploads in the current room.  You
        amy choose to allow uploads into only one room on your BBS, so that
        you can check files before posting them for download.   This will
        require more work on your part, but will protect you and your users
        from some types of vandalism to a greater extent than direct
        uploads will.  If you have a lot of "ruggies" in your area, this
        may be a good choice.
 
    [J] Downloads
        Toggle to allow or disallow file downloads in the current room.
 
    [K] Dice Enabled
        Toggle to allow or disallow die rolls in the current room.
 
    [L] Header
        Add or delete a header message for the current room.  The header is
        displayed upon entering the room unless the user has the system
        skip these headers for their account.
 
    [X] Exit
        Ends the room-editing session and returns you to the room prompt.
 
[I] Invite User
    You may invite a user to the current room if it has invitation only 
    status.
 
[K] Kill Room
    Delete this room from the system.  All messages will be erased and the 
    slot for this room will be open for a future room creation.
 
[L] List Aides
    Display a list of the high access users for the BBS, including 
    Aide, Co-SysOp, and SysOp status.
 
[M] Modify Misc Comment Field
    Change the miscellaneous comment field in the message header.  This
    function overrides any personal comment field that a user may have
    configured.  To erase any MCF, just type [RETURN] at the prompt.  The
    MCF is saved with the STK_INFA.SYS file, so if you re-boot your
    computer or re-run the BBS, the MCF will still be active.
 
[S] Set Date & Time
    Set your date or time.  Press [RETURN] if there is no change.
 
[U] Uninvite User
    You may un-invite a user from the current room if it has 
    invitation only status.

Voting Option
-------------
 
ST-Keep allows the sysop to configure an unlimited number of voter polls
for use on the system.  Votes can be made for all users, or specifically
for users in specific groups.  If you wish to have votes on your system,
you MUST place your poll files in the folder you designated when you ran
BBS_CNFG.PRG.  Two files are required to be created with a text editor by
the SysOp before each vote will be enabled.  VOTENAME.VOT contains the vote
question and the choices, the first 8 characters of the filename can be
your choice, but the extension must be "VOT" or "V##" for group only
votes.  VOTEANSW.ANS contains the number of answers to each choice, the
first 8 characters must match the corresponding vote filename, and the
extension must be "ANS".  You can create votes that can only be taken by
users in a specified group by using the group number as the last 2
characters in the VOT extension.
 
   The first line in each *.VOT file contains the number of the room you
wish the vote results to be posted in.  Please be certain that this room
number exists as an active room on your BBS.  If you do not have a "Vote"
room, you should set this room number equal to either the Aide or SysOp
room (3 or 4) or "0" and no message will be written to record each users
vote.  Ideally, you should have a "Vote" room in order to discuss the topic
and therefore the first line in your file should be equal to that room's
number (i.e. if youre "Vote" room is #23, the first line in your quesion
file will be 23.  To find a room number, either use [R]ead [I]nformation,
[J]umpto [RETURN], or [L]ist Rooms [RETURN] from any room prompt within the
BBS.  After the room number, you should enter a number for the amount of
choices in this particular vote.  Following that line, enter the actual
vote question next.  This can only be one line of data, but its length can
be up to 255 characters, therefore you can not have any special width
formatting in the actual message, ST-Keep will format this line to the
users screen width setting.  The last lines are the choices in the vote.  I
strongly suggest always including an "Other" and "No Opinion" answer for
obvious reasons (you can only have up to 26 choices in your vote including
these two).  Here is a sample vote question file (VOTETEST.VOT):
 
23
7
What telecommunications program do you use on your ST?
Flash
Interlink
Uniterm
STalker
Other
Freeze Dried Terminal
No Opinion
 
   The answer file (VOTETEST.ANS) should contain a "0" on separate lines
for each of your choices.  Since our vote has 6 choices, this is what the
file would look like:
 
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
 
   As you can see, this vote will be recorded in room number 23.  When you
wish to delete an old vote, just remove the VOT extension or delete the
file after you record the final results somewhere on your BBS.
 
Doors
-----
 
   Doors allow an external program (game, utility, etc...) to be run from
within ST-Keep while in a logon session from either a remote user or the
sysop.  If a remote user is running the program, the external program must
redirect IO to the modem itself, as ST-Keep doesn't do this.  Most all
on-line games do this, so you shouldn't have to worry about it.  Otherwise,
any GEM programs or programs that don't re-direct the IO should only be
executed from a local logon.  Also, your FREE RAM must be high enough to
support both ST-Keep and this external program.  An error message in
ST-Keep will occur if you do not have enough free RAM to run a door.  Keep
in mind that if you want group access for different doors, that those won't
appear on the menu for a normal user unless they are a member of that
group.  You can install or delete your own doors with any text editor or
the door editor program included in this archive.  Each door has 5 fields,
all on separate lines, although the file begins with one line stating the
total number of doors you have installed.  This is how the file
(STK_DOOR.SYS) would look with 3 doors installed:
 
3
1
Axolotl Football League
c:\afl\afl.tos
[blank line]
c:\afl\player.dat
15
Flash
c:\flash\flash.prg
[blank line]
[blank line]
2
Safari BBS
c:\bbs.prg
-BBS -pf:\bbs2\
[blank line]
 
   The first line tells ST-Keep how many doors you have installed, be sure
to change this number if you delete or add doors without using the door
editor.  The second line contains the group number of the AFL door,
remember, if users are not members of group 1 they can not get in this
door, so in this instance group 1 is our On-Line Games group.  Line 2 holds
the door name, line 3 the path/filename where this program to run can be
found.  The 4th line is a blank line (CR) for AFL.  The 5th line is only
used if you need to pass the players name to a specific filename, otherwise
it should be a blank line (CR) if it isn't necessary.  As you can see,
those 5 fields are repeated for my Flash door.
 
   If the doors don't work correctly, you're probably just setting the
path/filenames incorrectly or you don't have enough RAM.
 
   ST-Keep can call another program that requires the baud rate (i.e.
another BBS program including ST-Keep, FIDODOOR, etc...) as a door.  This
way you can allow users to enter a totally different system or run the
various networking programs available.  Line 4 of the door data is used for
this feature.  Simply place "-B" on this line and the program to be
executed will be passed the baud rate of the on-line user ("LOCAL" if
local) via the command line parameters.  ST-Keep will also create a
DORINFO1.DEF file in the directory of the new BBS program for use by
FIDODOOR or any other programs that may need the baud rate or door
information file.
 
Door Parameters
---------------
 
-B    Used to tell ST-Keep to treat the door program as a BBS.  ST-Keep
      will send out "LOCAL" on the command line if there is no carrier, and
      "-Bxxxx" (xxxx=baud rate) if there is a carrier so that the door
      program can use this information.
 
-D    Creates DORINFO1.DEF before executing the specified door program.
      This file will be created in the same folder as the door program that
      you wish to run.  FIDODOOR.TTP requires this file.
 
-P    Changes the directory AFTER executing your door program and writing
      DORINFO1.DEF if sent to another ST-Keep BBS.  This is helpfull for
      the bbs so that you only need one BBS.PRG on your drive but multiple
      BBSs can run off of it.  You need to append the pathname after this
      switch to designate the change (i.e.  "-Pc:\folder\").  ST-Keep will
      use the system files located in this folder rather than where BBS.PRG
      was executed from.
 
-T    Will pass 'text' along the command line.  This switch allows you to
      pass a constant string every time this door is executed.  You must
      pass the text directly after this switch (i.e.  "-Tcommand line").
 
-U    Passes only the username along the command line (for on-line games,
      etc...)
 
   You may not pass the -B, -T, or -U switches together as they conflict
with each other.  The other switches can be used together or with one of
these three.
 
Function Keys
-------------
 
[F1] Press this key to get a menu of the function keys available.
 
[F2] Go into chat mode with the current user; if you use this key while
     you are on-line locally, it will go into terminal mode.
 
[F3] Disable chat call toggle.  If a user [C]hats for the SysOp this will
     send a note to the user from NOCHAT.BLB which should basically state
     that "...the SysOp is not around so leave mail or try again later..."
     Chat Mode:  On/Off will be seen in the status line.
 
[F4] This will send a bunch of line noise over the modem, useful to
     terrorize your friends or just before using [F5].
 
[F5] Will drop DTR, hang up on the modem instantly.
  
[F6] Userboot # - enter a number from 0 through 9 after pressing this
     function key, the user will be sent the textfile called USERBOOT.# in
     your MSG directory.  # = the userboot number you chose.  You can
     create such textfiles as "Your time has expired!" or "Sorry, the sysop
     needs the system, please call back later."  After each userboot file
     is printed to the callers screen, the modem will drop carrier on them
     so you can have the system.
 
[F7] Allows access to the aide commands no matter who is online, be
     careful not to show the user anything you don't want them to see.
 
[F8] Allows access to the Co-SysOp commands, otherwise same as [F7].
 
[F9] Access to file commands while a user is on-line.
 
[F10] Status line toggle, if it's on, this will turn it off and give access
      to the full screen for the session.  If it is on, it holds 5 lines of
      information on the users account.  It is automatically turned on when
      a user calls if your system options are configured for it, but is not
      turned on when a user logs on from the console.
 
Function Key Macros
-------------------
 
   Each line in the STK_FUNC.SYS file can contain any text you wish.  Use
ALT-F# to send F1-F10 and ALT-SHIFT-F# to send F11-F20.
 
   These macros could contain such phrases as "Hello, how can I help
you?" so that you can send them when entering chat mode or even enable you
to logon faster if you made one of them your username and the other your
password, although this poses a security risk.
 
Backups
-------
 
    ST-Keep will automatically backup your system files after midnight when
the first caller logs off if you have this function enabled ([.][c][b]).
Just make sure the correct pathname is on your hard drive, and the files
will be copied over there.  You should put the backup files on a partition
other than the same one you're using for the BBS, so that if the BBS
partition fails you have the old files elsewhere.  If you need to restore
from a backup, you MUST copy ALL of the backup files to your BBS directory,
you can not pick and choose from various files.  If you lose just one or a
few of your SYS files, you will still need to copy all of the backup files
over.  Almost all the system files are related, especially the room.sys,
userlog.sys, and msg.sys files and they can't operate correctly if they
aren't from the same backup.  The backup feature doesn't check for enough
free space on your backup partition, so you should periodically check your
backup drive to make sure it has enough free space when you first start.
Once one backup is complete, ST-Keep will just overwrite those same files
so the amount of backup space required shouldn't change.  In the [.][C][O]
menu you'll find a backup files toggle.  This will toggle from copying each
file individually for the backup, or archiving them into one file with the
date of the backup.  You must have the archive program located where you
specified in BBS_CNFG.PRG in order for the backup to operate, if this file
can not be found a simple file copy will be made of each of the *.SYS
files.

Auto-Messages
-------------
  
NEWUSER.MSG - If this file is in your MSG directory, ST-Keep will save the
              contents in the file as a message from user account #1 to
              all new users after they finish their application.
 
HANGUP.MSG - If this file is in your MSG directory, ST-Keep will save the
             contents in the file as a message from user account #1 to all
             users who drop or lose carrier without terminating properly.
 
Moving & Deleting Messages
--------------------------
 
   When you use the aide command to move a message, ST-Keep remembers the
last room you moved any previous messages into.  This comes in handy when
you are moving a number of messages into the same room, you can just hit
[RETURN] for the room and the default will be the last room.  Initially
this room is set to the Aide room.  Any user may delete a message they
saved previously simply by pausing the message with [P] and then pressing
[D] to resume.  After the message is displayed, they will be asked to
confirm the deletion.  If the users have their message prompts turned on,
they can just press [D] at the prompt to delete the message if they were
the author.
 
Terminal Mode
-------------
 
   Use [F1] to change the baud rate, [F2] to toggle duplex, [UNDO] to
exit, and [HELP] to save the current chat buffer to a disk file.  I choose
not to enhance the terminal mode by adding an autodialer or other features
because it would be much easier for you to simply install your favorite
telecommunications package as a door with sysop only access and you'll have
all the features you'd ever need.
 
Downloading Files
-----------------
 
   Users may batch download from any room prompt that has directory status.
Batch downloads are only valid with Ymodem and Zmodem.
 
   You may notice XFERLIST.DAT and XFER_REC.DAT appear in your bbs folder.
They are used to record download/upload filenames and are not needed to the
BBS after a user logs off.  You can simply ignore this file.
 
AUTODESK.PRG
------------
 
   This program is supplied with ST-Keep to allow access to desk
accessories while keeping ST-Keep loaded.  Press the [CLR/HOME] key at any
time and ST-Keep will run AUTODESK.PRG.  You can then use your DA's and use
Quit to return to the BBS.
 
Dice Roller
-----------
 
[%] from any room except #1 will send the user to a dice menu.  This
    feature is handy for on-line RPG's or other games.
 
BBS Colors
----------
 
   Use the PolyChrome DA (COLOUR.ACC) to create STK_INFC.SYS.  This
contains the color information for your personal choices when running
BBS.PRG.  If this file is not present in your bbs directory, ST-Keep will
use your system colors so you could alternately use your control panel and
set your preferences.
 
Bulletins
---------
 
Permanent - *.BUP - Always shown to users when they logon
 
New       - *.BUL - Shown only once to each user unless it is updated

Group     - *.B## - Shown only once to each user if they are a member of
                    this group number.  Must be 01 to 15.

Color Graphics Emulation
------------------------
 
   You can insert color codes in your *.MNU files to enhance each users
VT-52, Instant Graphics & Sound, Blue Instant Graphics, or ANSI screen
configurations.  When ST-Keep shows any menu, it first looks for the
extension of V52 (for VT-52), IG (Instant Graphics & Sound), BIG (Blue
Instant Graphics) or ANS (for ANSII) and if it can't find any of these it
will use MNU.  Simply use a text editor or a special VT-52 or ANSII editor
to create menues for each type of emulation.  To create IGS menues you will
need to obtain the latest version of IGS found on most BBSs.  To create
BIG menues, you can obtain the Blue Instant Graphics documentation from an
IBM BBS and modify your IGS scripts to work with B.I.G. (be sure to save
them with the new extension of BIG; IGS and BIG are not 100% compatible).
