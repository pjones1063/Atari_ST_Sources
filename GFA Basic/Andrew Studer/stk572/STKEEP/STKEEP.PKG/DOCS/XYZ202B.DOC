                       XYZ v2.02 Quick Reference

Beta version notes:
I wasn't able to find a system I could test the new uploading code, so
it's quite likely there are problems with it.   If you have problems
with the new XYZ, run it with the -vlog.txt option, and mail me the
log.txt file it creates.

XYZ version 2.02 is an enhanced version of v2.01.  New features:

 o YMODEM-G is now supported.
 o 32 bit CRCs are now supported, for extra safe file transfers.
 o XYZ will no longer time out when saving if the remote system takes
   a long time to save the file.
 o Improved serial port handling.
 o Recovery from invalid escape character fixed -- this was giving
   "subpacket too long" errors.
 o Extended ZMODEM options are now supported.
   
New commands:
Remember, any option that takes a parameter must have the parameter right
after the option.  Do not put a space between them.

RIGHT:  -yg
WRONG:  -y g

-yg     Use -yg to transfer files via YMODEM-G.  Use just -y as before for
        a regular YMODEM session.

-z	New suboptions are supported.  The ZMODEM Transport options
	for recovery, overwriting, and file protection are supported.
	Note that only one can be specified.  The Transoport options
	only affect the receiver, but can be specified at either end.
	If the side uploading specifies an option, and the side
	downloading doesn't, the uploader's options will be used.  If
	the downloader specifies an option, that is what will be used,
	overriding the uploader.  If neither end specifies an option,
	the default options will be used.
 
	The suboptions are:
-zr	Recovery.  (default)
	If a file with the same name exists, XYZ will assume
	that it was from a previous, interrupted session.  XYZ will
	resume the transfer where it left off.  If the uploader specifies
	overwrite or clobber, you can use this option to override it on
	the downloading side.
-zy	Overwrite.
	If the file exists, it will be overwritten, and resent in full.
-zp	Protect.
	If a file exists, skip it.  The file will not be modified.

See XYZ.DOC for full information on all of the new features.

Command line examples:

                        No options means do a ZMODEM download to the
                        current default folder

c:\download             Do a ZMODEM download to the DOWNLOAD folder on
                        drive C

-y                      Do a YMODEM download to the default folder

-y c:\download          Do a YMODEM download to the DOWNLOAD folder on
                        drive C

-x file1.arc            Do a XMODEM download of FILE1.ARC to the default
                        folder (a filename must always be used with XMODEM)

To upload, put -u on the command line, along with the filename or filenames
(up to ten) to be uploaded.  They may contain wildcards, and all files that
match a wildcard pattern will be sent.

Examples:

-u e:\uploads\*.*       Do a ZMODEM upload of all files in the UPLOADS folder

-u afile.txt            Do a ZMODEM upload of AFILE.TXT that's in the default
                        folder

-u *.*                  Do a ZMODEM upload of all files in the default folder
                        NOTE: If this is the folder XYZ.TTP is in, it will
                        send itself, so watch out.

-u -iFILELIST.TXT	Do a ZMODEM upload of all the files listed in the
			text file FILELIST.TXT

-y -u e:\uploads\*.ARC      Send all ARC files in the UPLOADS folder
                                using YMODEM

XMODEM can only send one file.  If you use wildcards, only the first file
that matches will be sent.

-x -u afile.txt             Send AFILE.TXT from the default folder using
                                XMODEM

-x1k -u a:\bfile.txt        Send BFILE.TXT from the root directory on drive
                                A using XMODEM with 1k blocks

If you have any problems, run XYZ with the -vlog.txt command, and send me
the LOG.TXT file, along with any comments you may have.  I can be reached as
STARFALL on GEnie.
