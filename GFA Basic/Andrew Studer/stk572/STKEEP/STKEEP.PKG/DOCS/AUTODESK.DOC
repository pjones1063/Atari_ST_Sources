AutoDesk v1.7
Copyright 1992 by Pandamonium Software
Programmed by Andrew P. Studer

AutoDesk is a simple GEM program that allows you to access your desk
accessories (*.ACC) from various programs that don't have their own
menu bars but do allow execution of external applications.

I originally wrote this program for SysOps of my BBS software
(ST-Keep) but found that others would be interested in such a utility
so I released it separately.  You could run it from a command line
interpreter, other applications that allows you to execute external
programs, and even other BBS programs.

Simply select the DA you wish to use and then select "Quit" in the
"File" menu or press "ALT-Q" to exit AutoDesk.
