Description
-----------
This program will backup, using compression, all the files which you specify
into a file that is named based on the current date (i.e.  07_06_92.LZH) for
better file management.

Instructions
------------
The program should be set up as an EVENT within ST-Keep or your unattended
mailer (although you could run it manually) and doesn't require any
parameters.  It does, however, require a data file from which it reads the
required information to create the archive.  The data file should be named
STK_BACK.SYS and reside in the same folder as BBS_BACK.PRG.  The structure of
the data file is as follows:

Line 1:  pathname to save archived file to (ending with a backslash)
Line 2:  pathname and filename of your archiver
Line 3:  up to 100 lines of files to backup
...
Line 103: last possible file to backup

Example:

F:\BACKUP\
C:\UTIL\ARC\LHARC.TTP
C:\BBS\*.SYS
C:\BBS\MSG\*.MSG
C:\BBS\SYSOP.MSG

As you can see, I have my archived files sent to the "F:\BACKUP\" folder and
use LHARC.TTP to archive the files that follow.  All the *.SYS files in the
\BBS folder on drive C: are archived along with any *.MSG files in the \MSG
folder inside \BBS in addition to the SYSOP.MSG file in the \BBS folder.

Only ARC.TTP and the various LHARC.TTP (LZH201?.TTP, etc...) programs will
work as the BBS_BACK.PRG utility uses "u" (update) as the archive command.
The program will add the .ARC or .LZH extension to the date filename as
required.

The backup will run faster if you use wildcards wherever possible, simply
because it only executes the archiver program once per line when using
wildcards, otherwise, it will run the archiver program once for every
distinct file that it locates in the SYS file.  You could, however, type out
the path and filenames of every single file that you wanted backed up.
