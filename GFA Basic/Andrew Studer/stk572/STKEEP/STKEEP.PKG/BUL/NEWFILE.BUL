ATTENTION ALL USERS:
===================

I am testing out a new file transfer command system.

Press [F] at any room prompt to enter the file directory/transfer menu.  Type
[?] to review the menu of commands.

Hopefully, this will streamline the command system, too many users complained
about the [1]directory, [@] extended new directory commands not being
organized.

If you have any comments or suggestions, let me know!
