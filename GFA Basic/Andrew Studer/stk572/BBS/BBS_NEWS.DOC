ST-Keep Bulletin Board System Update News
-----------------------------------------

13Nov94

Changed the top 10 logs to not include user account 1 or SYSOP.

Added a new [.][c][o] feature to disallow name changes, handles and
real names.

10Nov94

The waitcall screen always reported 0 new messages since the last
start, I was referencing the wrong variable name.  It's fixed now.

30Oct94

Wow, I guess I haven't been updating this file as much as I have the
program.

At some point, the write privs flag was broken.  I fixed it today
after some pushing by Jeff Fehlman, :).  If you edit a user and
disable their message writing abilities, it now stops then from
writing messages with [E].

15Jul94

Update to BBS_CNFG.PRG - now allows changing the chat enabled and
chat disbled times with option menu B.

Update to BBS_UCMP.PRG - the userlog compactor will not properly
handle any held message or held files for each user.  These files
were being ignored before so if a compaction was done, they were
assigned to the wrong user.  I totally overlooked this but now the
compactor is aware of the need and deletes held files from deleted
accounts and re-names these files for accounts that change position
in the userlog.

Buf fix on maintaining older messages, ST-Keep would start to think
you had more old messages than you really did.

Removed any references to the old KEY file and registration numbers.

Changes MENU MODE under [x][n] so that if it is enabled, Message
prompts are automatically turned on.  This was required because the
menu would kick in after the last message and you wouldn't get to
read it.  Thus, message prompts will always be on if you are using
menu mode.

08Mar94

Oops, but in 28Feb's update.  It works now.

28Feb94

New switch for each user in [x][n][o]... the ability to disable/enable the
display of PCFs and MCFs in the message header.  It will be DISABLED as a
default, so you'll need to tell your users to enable it if they wish to see
the PCFs of other users.

19Feb94

BBS_UCMP.PRG will no longer leave an STK_USER.OLD file after compressing the
new one into STK_USER.SYS.  The *.OLD file is deleted.  This helps if you
want to automate your compaction process so you wont' have to delete the old
userlog or include a delete command for this file in your batchfile.  It was
mainly there in the beginning to make sure we had a backup in case a bug
appeared.

06Feb94

If a user had files on hold for downloading and the files no longer exist in
the same directory as when the user marked them, when the user logs-on, these
files not found will be removed from the download list.

05Feb94

Bug fix.  BBS_UCMP.PRG wasn't reading/writing the newest update to INFA.SYS
properly, but it is now!

01Jan94 *** Happy New Year ***

Fixed [M]ove file from/to room command so it wouldn't delete the file in
question if there wasn't enough room on the destination. Does not copy file
description if file doesn't copy.

Updates status line after [J]umpto within the file command.

Yikes! This baby didn't want to compile. I had to rip out some more code and
optimize elsewhere.  Grrr! This is the last time I re-compile!

You need to add two lines to STK_INFA.SYS, 49 and 50.  Line 49 is the starting
time that your chat mode is available in military hours (ex, 6am would be
0600, 1030pm would be 2230).  Line 50 is the ending time for your chat mode in
military hours.  NOTE:  Line 49 must be LESS THAN line 50.  If your main chat
mode toggle is disabled, neither of these values will have an effect and chat
will not be possible as previously.

19Oct93

You must add a new line to STK_NEWD.SYS - just add a '0' which will make 4
lines in this file.  This line will contain the total number of messages
entered since the sysops last login.

18Jul93

Lines in TWIT.SYS are now also checked for passwords.  Thus, if the current
users handle, real name, or password is matched in the TWIT.SYS file on one
of the lines, the user will not be allowed on (an immediate "Goodbye!" +
disconnect will occur as if they used their 3 logon attempts).

Running ST-Keep from itself as a door was sorta broken.  While it would work
over the modem, a local entry into ST-Keep as a door went to the waitcall()
screen rather than the logon() screen.  This is now fixed.  Use -B as the BBS
switch from ST-Keep for running ST-Keep as a door.

20May93

STK_TWIT.SYS will be searched during new user applications for usernames that
you do not wish to allow accounts for on your system.  If this file does not
exist, this feature is effectively disabled.  Each username you want to twit
out must be on a separate line (case insenstive).  Username and real name
will be checked in this file.

OLD NOTE:

Privileges are as follows:

Unvalidated        New accounts in secured system can not logon until
                   the sysop validates the account.  Application only
                   accepted.
Secured            New accounts in limited system, can only leave mail to
                   sysop once per day.
Messages           Read & write message access
File Transfers     File upload & download access
Doors              Door access
Aide               Aide commands ( [.A] )
Co-SysOp           Co-SysOp & File commands ( [.C] & [.F] )
SysOp              SysOp commands

There is a major change with relation to access levels and group settings as
of his release.  Play close attention to the following:

Access Level now is simply a pointer to a user's HOME GROUP.  That is to say,
when a new user applies, group 0 will be assigned if your system is CLOSED
and group 1 will be assigned if OPEN.  This group pointer may be changed by
using .cu or .cu for a specific user or by using the mass userlog editor.
The benefit is that you don't have to set a users maximum minutes, download
ratio, and other information separately (taking a number of commands per
user).  You can simply edit a users group pointer, and ST-Keep will change
various other user settings based on your selections below (with
BBS_PRIVS.PRG).  Also, if you set your new user group correctly, you may not
have to edit any users at all, unless you wish to put them in special groups.
My system is set up to give new users (STK_GRPA.001) specified time per day,
10 downloads to one upload, and access to on-line games.  I'll only have to
edit a user if they become a member of the Atari Computer Users Group, and
then, I'll only have to edit one field in their record, instead of 4 or 5!

Whenever this pointer is changed (new user, .cu/.ca, or the ME.PRG), this
number will actually be used as a group number to load access information
from a file in the format "STK_GRPA.###" which is located in your system
folder.  ### is the group number, currently valid only for 000-255.  The file
extention must be padded on the left with zero's (i.e.  "stk_grpa.000",
"stk_grpa.011", etc...) Each file may contain the following information, each
option on it's own line:

   *** PLEASE USE BBS_PRIVS.PRG to create this file as you may be confused 
                                                       by the bit settings
   MINPERDAY=#
   This number can only be from 0-255, if not located, your system default
   will be used.

   MAXMINPERCALL=#
   This number can only be from 0-255, if not located, your system default
   will be used.

   XFERRATIO=#
   This number can only be from 0-255, if not located, your system default
   will be used.

   GROUPS=###
   This number MUST contain 16 digits, each of which can only be a 1 or a 0
   representing ON and OFF bits for each group on your system.  The leftmost
   bit is group #15, and the rightmost bit is group #0.

   PRIVS=###
   This number can only be from 0-255 and matches the bit settings stated in
   the mods on 21Apr93.  To obtain the correct value, you must turn each bit
   on for each privilege in this bit.  I will supply a program that will give
   you the proper value to place in this spot (BBS_PRIV.PRG).

Thus, STK_GRPA.000 is for new users in a CLOSED system, and STK_GRPA.001 is
for new users in an OPEN system.  All the other group pointers are available
to you for personalizing as your BBS requires.

Once you create a STK_GRPA.### for each group, you should edit the access
level for each user individually or with the mass userlog editor if you wish
these group settings to take effect.

If the appropriate file is not found, none of these settings will change for
the current user.

The GROUPS keywords is not required and you my desire to edit your GRPA.*
files after creating them with PRIVS.PRG so that all your users won't have
their GROUP access bits changed from their current values.  This keyword
is best used on NEW users and therefore you can use PRIVS.PRG to put it back
in once you modify all your current users with BBS_ME.PRG.

If you have any suggestions for additional access settings in these files, let
me know and I will add them if appropriate.

I realize these are some complicated changes and can be confusing, so please
ask questions before you install this latest version of ST-Keep if you are
not sure what you are doing.  Jeff Fehlman has been running this version for
a week and might also be of assistance as he has his system configured
totally different than mine.

10Apr93

[~] from any room prompt may now be used by Co-SysOps to access Co-SysOp
commands.

14Mar93

BBS_ME.PRG has been updated to allow running it with a command line that will
automatically delete unused accounts based on the number you send it.  The
required command line arguments are as follows:

-B###                ### > baud rate, usually 0, up to 19200
-L#                    # > 0 line feeds on, 1 line feeds off
-D###                ### > number of days which must have passed after
                           which to delete unused accounts.  Be sure your
                           computer's system date and time are current or
                           you'll end up with unwanted results.  This number
                           can be from 1-32000.

A perfect use for this function is to create an event in either ST-Keep or
BinkleyTerm that will execute this program to delete accounts that have been
inactive for 90 days (or whatever your choice).  You can run this event as often
as you like, once a week should be enough although you may use it once a day.

03Mar93

Added a new switch when running ST-Keep as a door.  -R### passes the number
of minutes allowed to the user UNDER ALL CONDITIONS (even SysOp access) when
the BBS is run from a door.  The value can be from 1-255.
