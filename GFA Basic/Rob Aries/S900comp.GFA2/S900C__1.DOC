€ Thanks for downloading the S900 Companion.  This program is designed to
 keep you away from the S900's front panel as much as possible!  I feel that
 in terms of features, it rivals any comercial editor--not that there even
 IS one for the Atari ST and S900.

 THE OBLIGATORY DISCLAIMER:

 A NOTE ON THE TWO VERSIONS:

 There are two versions of the S900 Companion; one for high-resolution mono
 monitors, and one for medium-res color monitors.  The program was
 originally mono-only, but when my monitor died I started using my color
 monitor again (it had been sitting on a shelf for a few years!).  Since I
 needed to use the S900 Companion immediately, I found the quickest solution
 was to simply go through my code and modify it to work with the color
 monitor.

 OVERVIEW

 First of all, this documentation assumes that you're familiar with the
 S900, and that you are using its disk-based version 2 operating system. The
 S900 Companion will work with the version 1.2 system, except that editing
 the additional v2.0 program parameters on the Keygroup Edit page will have
 no audible effect (if you save the program and later use it with the v2.0
 OS installed, though, the edits _will_ be recognized).  The S900 Companion
 has NOT been tested with the version 1.0 system.  The sampler's OS version
 is shown on the sampler's LCD display when it's turned on.

 The S900 Companion has three pages.  The first (Main) is where program-
 level operations are performed.  Here is where you request, transmit, load,
 and save programs.  Also, block keygroup operations are done here, i.e.,
 whole keygroups can be copied or deleted with a few mouse clicks.

 The Main page is also where you can create a new S900 program by copying
 chosen keygroups from other, existing programs.  This is similar to the
 "put" and "get" feature of Akai's v2.0 system for the sampler, except you
 don't have to do it one keygroup at a time (not to mention that using the
 mouse sure beats scrolling around the S900's LCD display)!

 The Output Map page is where a Main page's program's output assignments are
 graphically displayed.  This is especially useful with programs that use
 the S900's individual outs, as oftentimes two or more keygroups may share
 an output.  Because the sampler's individual outputs are monophonic, it
 takes some planning to prevent sounds from being cut off.  The Output Map
 page allows quick editing of a program's output assignments to help in this
 regard.

 The third page of the S900 Companion is the Keygroup Edit page, where every
 parameter of an S900 keygroup is shown and available for editing using the
 mouse.  In addition, you can cut & paste individual parameters' values
 between selected keygroups or to every keygroup of a Main page program.
 Also, a feature I call "conditional editing" allows you to set up
 conditions where a paste may or may not occur--For instance, you could
 change the attack time of an envelope only on keygroups assigned to output
 #7, or lower the LFO rate on every keygroup except those on midi channel
 10, etc.

 Since the S900 doesn't support parameter change system-exclusive messages,
 the "read-modify-write" technique of editing is used.  First, a program is
 requested from the sampler into the computer; all editing then takes place
 in the computer.  When you're finished, the edited program must be sent
 back to the sampler (where you'll want to store it on the S900's own disk,
 although the S900 Companion can load and save S900 programs in standard
 midiex format).

 KEYGROUP EDITING OVERVIEW

 S900 programs are edited one keygroup at a time.  When in the Keygroup Edit
 page, you are NOT editing a keygroup from a Main page program directly;
 rather, the selected keygroup is first copied into one of ten "Keygroup
 Edit Buffers", herein referred to as "KEB's".  When you're done editing,
 the keygroup is copied back into the Main page program.  When a keygroup
 has been copied from a Main page program into a KEB, that KEB is considered
 "linked" to the Main page keygroup it was copied from.  The concept of
 linking is important to the operation of the S900 Companion and has
 implications for quite a few of its features.

 The S900 Companion also lets you create a program from scratch, by simply
 moving to an empty KEB, initializing it, then editing it to your
 satisfaction.  There need not be a Current or Composite program present in
 order to do this; when the KEB data is copied back to one of the Main page
 programs, the S900 Companion will create it for you.

 Since all editing takes place in the computer you may be wondering how
 you'll be able to hear what you're doing.  When in the Keygroup Edit page,
 the S900 Companion uses the sampler as a "virtual work buffer"; a special,
 one-keygroup program is created in the S900 Companion and transmitted to
 the sampler each time an edit is done.  You use the right mouse button to
 "play" this program, allowing you to hear the results of your editing.

 **A note of caution:  There are a few instances where certain operations
   will overwrite data already present, WITHOUT an alert box warning you, or
   any way to "undo" the operation.  This was a conscious decision on my
   part to avoid a lot of "Are you sure?" dialogs that can slow down the
   "power user".  In most cases these operations involve several steps, or a
   very specific combination of keypresses (like holding the <Control> and
   <Alt> key simultaneously), so it's assumed that you know what you're
   doing when you invoke them! Throughout this documentation you'll see
   warnings similar to this one (indented paragraphs preceded by two
   asterisks) whenever such an operation is detailed.

 THE MAIN PAGE

 When you run the S900 Companion, the first screen you'll see is the Main
 page.  The two large boxes, labeled "Current" and "Composite" program,
 refer to the two S900 programs that "live" in the S900 Companion.  When you
 load, save, request or transmit a program you are always doing it with the
 CURRENT program.  The Composite program is created in the S900 Companion by
 copying selected keygroups from the Current program or from a KEB.  In
 order to save the Composite program or transmit it to the S900, you must
 click on the "Swap" button; the Composite program becomes the Current, and
 vice-versa.

 The first step in editing an existing S900 program is to request it from
 the sampler.  If you're creating a program from scratch you don't need to
 have any particular program in the S900, but in all cases you MUST have the
 samples you need present!

 There must always be two-way communications from the ST to the sampler, and
 the basic midi channel in the S900 must match the channel number
 check-marked under the "Midi Channel" menu (unless the S900 is in 'omni'
 mode, in which case the channel set in the S900 Companion doesn't matter).

 Requesting a program:

 Select "Get Program" from the File menu.  Assuming no problem with midi
 communications, the Current program box should display a list of all the
 programs in the sampler.  Click on the desired program to request it; to
 abort, click anywhere other than on one of the displayed program names.  If
 there is a Current program already present, and one or more of its
 keygroups are linked to KEB's (i.e., you have been editing them), a small
 message box will appear for about one second to remind you of this,
 because...

 **An existing Current program will be overwritten by the requested program,
   with no warning alert or undoing possible.

 When a program has been requested into the S900 Companion, its keygroups
 will be listed in the Current program box (the loud and/or soft sample
 names are displayed, depending on each keygroup's Velocity Switch
 parameter).  If there are more than 17 keygroups in the program, a
 downward-pointing arrow will appear at the bottom of the box.  Click there
 to see the remaining keygroups; the arrow will change to point upwards.
 Click there again to return to the first display, and so on.

 Sending the Current program to the sampler:

 When you are finished editing a program, it should be sent back to the
 sampler.  There are two ways to send the Current program to the S900:

   1. Press the space bar.  The Current program is sent immediately.  If a
      program with the same name exists in the sampler, it will be
      *replaced* by the Current program; otherwise, the Current program will
      be *added* to those already in the S900, *space permitting*.

   2. Select "Send Program" from the File menu.  Similarly to the "Get
      Program" option, the Current program box changes to display a list of
      programs in the sampler.

     --Click on a program name to *overwrite* that program with the Current
       program, space permitting.

     --Click anywhere else in the Current program box to *add* the Current
       program to those in the sampler, space permitting. (Caution: If the
       Current program's name matches that of any program already in the
       S900, the Current program will _replace_ that program).

     --Click anywhere outside the Current program box to abort.

 The first method is meant to save time in straightforward editing
 situations, where you've requested a program , edited it in some way, and
 just need to shoot it right back to the sampler.  The edited program will
 automatically replace the program that was originally requested (unless
 you've changed its name).  The second method gives you more flexibility by
 allowing you to send the Current program to any existing S900 program
 location, or add it to those already there.

 After a program has been sent to the sampler, the S900 Companion sends a
 "catalog request" message to the S900 and updates the program list
 displayed in the Current program box.  This is meant to give visual
 feedback that the transfer was successful.  Of course this feature is most
 effective when the Current program has a different name from that of any
 program already in the S900--If the new name is displayed then it's obvious
 the transfer worked.  If the Current program name is the same as one
 already in the sampler, this feature is a little more problematic--i.e.,
 the program name will be displayed whether or not the Current program
 actually replaced the S900 program of the same name or not.  If the number
 of keygroups in the Current program is the same or less than the number of
 keygroups in the S900 program it's replacing, you can be fairly certain
 that the transfer worked.

 The most probable reason for an unsuccessful transfer, other than a problem
 with midi communications, would be if you exceeded the S900's
 program/keygroup limit--That's what's meant by "*space permitting*".  I
 have found that the total number of keygroups, programs, and samples added
 together cannot exceed 66.

 After approximately one second, the updated program list is cleared and the
 Current program box will change back to displaying the keygroup list.

 Changing/Copying a program's name:

 Clicking the mouse in the name field of either the Current or Composite
 program lets you change its name or copy the name from the other program
 (the latter function is available only if both programs are present in the
 S900 Companion).  The alert boxes should be self-explanatory.  As you may
 know, two programs with the same name can't exist in the S900; use the
 rename function if you've requested a program from the sampler, edited it
 in some way, and want to send it back while keeping the original program in
 the S900.  Also, this option lets you use lower-case characters and other
 ASCII characters in your program name, something the S900 doesn't.

 MAIN PAGE KEYGROUP OPERATIONS

 Selecting Keygroups:

 As mentioned earlier, the main page is where block keygroup operations are
 performed.  These operations are represented by the three buttons in the
 middle of the screen, and work only on _selected_ keygroups (with one
 exception, which will be detailed shortly).

 To select a keygroup, click on it; its text will highlight.  To de-select,
 click on it again.  The two buttons under each program box affect the
 selection process:  The first, "S. ALL" (select all), is a quick way to do
 exactly that.  The second button is marked "DE-SEL" (de-select), and is
 initially greyed-out and unavailable.  Once a keygroup or keygroups have
 been selected, the button text becomes normal.  Clicking on "DE-SEL" now
 _temporarily_ de-selects any selected keygroups in that program.  The
 button inverts and the text changes to "RE-SEL" (re-select), and the
 selected keygroups will un-highlight; clicking there again restores the
 previous selections, and changes the button text back to "DE-SEL".
 <SHIFT>-clicking on "DE-SEL" will _permanently_ de-select any selected
 keygroups.

 If you select another keygroup while keygroups are temporarily de-selected,
 an alert box will warn you that your previous selections will be cancelled
 if you proceed.

 Keygroup Operations:

   COPY -->   All selected keygroups in the Current program are copied to
              the Composite program.  Keygroups in the Composite program,
              selected or not, are not affected.  This is one way a new
              program is created, and is roughly analogous in concept to the
              "Put" and "Get" feature of the S900's v2.0 operating system,
              only a little quicker!  If there is no Composite program, one
              will be created, named "*Untitled*".

   The exception mentioned earlier: <SHIFT>-clicking on this button copies
   the _entire_ Current program to the Composite program, regardless of any
   selected keygroups in either program.  If a Composite program already
   exists, it will be overwritten by this operation (in this case, an alert
   box will give you a chance to abort, otherwise the copy happens
   immediately).

   DELETE     **All selected keygroups in both the Current and Composite
              programs are deleted.  There is no undo for this!

   If any of the selected keygroups are linked to KEB's, an alert box will
   pop up to remind you.  The alert box offers three choices:

     --"All":  All selected keygroups are deleted, whether or not they are
               linked to a KEB.

     --"Leave":  All selected keygroups NOT linked to a KEB are deleted;
                 those that are linked will remain (and remain selected)
                 after the deletion.

     --"Cancel":  The entire operation is cancelled.

   If none of the selected keygroups are linked, the deletions happen
   immediately; the alert box come up _only_ if one or more of the selected
   keygroups are linked.

   COPY \|/   All selected keygroups are replicated within their respective
              programs.

 The "29-keygroup" bug and other anomalies:

 As mentioned previously, I've discovered through experimentation that the
 total number of samples, keygroups and programs in the S900 added together
 can't exceed 66.  It's quite possible to create a single program with 64
 keygroups if they all play the same sample (and that sample is the only one
 in the S900).  Requesting such a program will most likely overrun the ST's
 midi buffer and lock up the computer.  Since the display box can show 17
 keygroups at a time, and there are two "pages" to it, I strongly advise you
 to not request a program with more than 34 keygroups!  In any event you
 won't be able to send it back intact to the sampler, because the S900 has a
 bug that corrupts any program sent to it with more than 29 keygroups; any
 number over that will contain only garbage.  Because of this, the S900
 Companion will limit the copy & replicate functions described above so that
 neither the Current or Composite program will contain more than 29
 keygroups (this limit also applies to keygroups added to either program
 from the Keygroup Edit page).  If any operation would result in this 29-
 keygroup limit being exceeded, an alert box will inform you.  You'll have
 the option of copying the first 'n' number of selected keygroups up to the
 maximum of 29, or aborting the process completely.

 Note that you can request a program with up to 34 keygroups, and it'll
 transfer successfully into the S900 Companion; just understand that you
 won't be able to send the whole program _back_ to the sampler.

 Loading and saving files:

 The S900 Companion allows you to load and save S900 programs to an Atari
 disk in midiex (pure system-exclusive) format (i.e., any program that
 handles midiex files can send these files to an S900).  This can be a
 convenience in certain circumstances (such as temporarily storing a program
 while you request or load others into the S900 Companion) but you should
 always remember that the best place for an S900 program file is on the
 Akai's own disk, along with the samples it uses!

 These functions are accessed with the "Load" and "Save" menu items in the
 "File" menu, and affect the _Current program only_.

 **Just as in requesting a program, loading one will trash any existing
   Current program with no warning alert or undoing possible.  If one or
   more of the existing Current program's keygroups are linked to a KEB, a
   small message box will pop up for about one second with a message to that
   effect as a reminder.

 The "Swap" button:

 Since transfers and file operations operate only on the Current program,
 you must use this function if you want to send the Composite program to the
 S900, or save it to disk.  It does exactly what it says!  Note that the
 selection status of any keygroups (whether they are selected or temporarily
 de-selected) are swapped as well.

 Deleting a program:

 To dump an entire program, you could click on the "S. ALL" button under the
 appropriate program box, then click on the "DELETE" button in the middle of
 the screen.  Another way is provided by <SHIFT>-clicking on "DELETE" and
 answering the alert box.  If any of the program's keygroups are linked to
 KEB's, the alert box will contain a message to that effect as a reminder.
 Unlike the alert presented when deleting individual keygroups, this one
 does not give you the option of leaving linked keygroups; the only options
 are to delete the entire program or abort the operation entirely.

 THE OUTPUT MAP PAGE

 Choosing "Output Map" under the "Edit" menu takes you to a screen where a
 Main page program's output routing is graphically displayed.  This page is
 best suited to help work with programs that use the sampler's individual
 outputs; the fact that they're monophonic make for some tricky keygroup
 assignment when more than one keygroup share an output (anyone who's used
 the S900 for drums knows all about this!).  Of course, programs that use
 the sampler's stereo or mix outputs can also be displayed.

 If there is both a Current and a Composite program present, an alert box
 will ask you to choose the program whose output map you want to display.
 Then, the S900 Companion examines the program's output assignment scheme
 and moves to one of three screens, depending on whether the program uses
 the S900's individual, stereo, or mix outs.

 (As you may know, due to the nature of the S900's output scheme, it's very
 unlikely that the program would contain keygroups assigned to individual
 AND mix or L&R outs.  If such is the case, another alert box will ask you
 to choose the desired output display before it's drawn.  The S900 Companion
 can't display keygroups in such "mixed" assignments on the same screen).

 All three screens allow you to delete keygroups from the program.  In
 addition, the individual and stereo output screen let you change a
 keygroup's output assignment (only within a screen's output type, however;
 for instance, you can't change a keygroup's output assignment from an
 individual to a mix or stereo output here--That must be done on the
 Keygroup Edit page).

 The Individual Output display:

 The screen is divided into eight collumns with small circles representing
 the S900's eight individual outputs at the bottom.  There is enough room on
 the screen to show four keygroups in each collumn (five for the monochrome
 version of the S900 Companion).  If there are more keygroups than this
 assigned to a particular output, you'll see a small upward-pointing
 arrowhead at the top of a collumn.  Click there to see the additional
 keygroups assigned to that output.  A downward-pointing arrowhead will
 appear, letting you know that there are four keygroups "below" the ones
 you're currently looking at.  Click there to return to the first display,
 and so on. <Shift>-clicking on the up or down-arrowhead moves you
 immediately to the extreme of each range.

 The Stereo Output Display:

 Here, the screen is divided into two halves representing the left and right
 outputs, with each half able to display up to 16 keygroups.  Similar to the
 individual output screen, arrowheads at the top of the screen indicate
 additional keygroups assigned to that output.

 The Mix output display:

 On this screen, up to 32 keygroups are displayed.  Since the S900 Companion
 is designed to accommodate programs with up to 34 keygroups, once again
 you'll get the arrowheads at the top of the screen in the unlikely event
 that the program contains more than 32 keygroups.

 Deleting keygroups:

 **<Control>+<alt>-clicking on a keygroup deletes it.  There is no undo for
   this!

 Unlike the main page, you WON'T be told if a keygroup is linked to a KEB;
 the deletion happens immediately.  Also, you won't be able to delete all
 the keygroups from a program; that must be done on the main page.

 When a keygroup is deleted from the individual or stereo output screen,
 only the corresponding collumn or side is re-drawn.  Because of this,
 keygroups in other collumns or the other stereo output may now be numbered
 incorrectly.  Pressing the space bar will re-draw the entire screen with
 the correct keygroup numbering.  This feature isn't needed on the mix
 output screen since the entire screen is re-drawn anytime a keygroup is
 deleted.
 Editing the output assignments:

 On the individual and stereo output screens, you can edit the output
 assignments by simple click & drag operations:

   --To move a keygroup from one output to another, click the mouse on it,
     and while continuing to hold the mouse button down, drag the image of
     the keygroup box to the desired output collumn (individual output
     screen), or the opposite side of the screen (stereo output screen).
     The position of the mouse when you release the button isn't critical as
     long as it's somewhere in the correct collumn or side.  If you change
     your mind, just release the mouse button in the SAME collumn or side
     you started with.

   --To swap two keygroup's output assignments, <control>-click on the first
     keygroup box and drag it to the keygroup box you want to swap outputs
     with. (It's not necessary to continue to hold the <control> key as you
     drag).  Of course, in this case the position of the mouse when you
     release the button is important; the mouse pointer should be inside the
     keygroup box you want to swap with.

 You should know that if you edit a keygroup's output assignment on this
 page, and it's linked to a KEB, the KEB's output will be changed as well.

 Pressing the <Esc> key returns you to the Main page.

 THE KEYGROUP EDIT PAGE

 The Keygroup Edit page is where any one of ten Keygroup Edit buffers
 (KEB's) are displayed.  The usual procedure in editing existing programs,
 as described previously, is to copy a keygroup from the Current or
 Composite program into one of the KEB's.  This can be done from both the
 Main and Output map page by simply <shift> or <alt>-clicking on the
 keygroup you want to edit:

   <SHIFT>-clicking on a keygroup on the Main page copies it to the first
   available empty KEB and moves you immediately to the Keygroup Edit page,
   with that KEB displayed.

   <SHIFT>-clicking on a keygroup on the Output Map page copies it to the
   first available empty KEB and moves you to the Keygroup Edit page, UNLESS
   the chosen keygroup has previously been copied to a KEB (ie, is already
   linked to a KEB), in which case you'll just move to the Keygroup edit
   page with that KEB displayed.

   <ALT>-clicking on a keygroup on the Main page copies it to the first
   available empty KEB, WITHOUT going to the Keygroup Edit page, in case you
   want to copy several keygroups into KEB's before editing them.

   <ALT>-clicking on a keygroup on the Output Map page does the same thing,
   UNLESS the chosen keygroup is already linked to a KEB, in which case a
   message box will pop up for about one second, telling you which KEB the
   keygroup is already linked to.

 **Important:  Once all ten KEBs' have been filled, any subsequent copying
   of keygroups will be made to KEB #10.  Any data already in that buffer
   will be overwritten, with no warning and no undoing possible.

 You can also move to the Keygroup Edit page by selecting "Keygroup", under
 the Edit menu.  In this case, you'll move to the Keygroup Edit page with
 the last KEB you were editing (or the last KEB that a Main page keygroup
 was copied into) displayed; if entering for the first time, you'll be in
 KEB #1.  This would be the first step in creating an S900 program from
 scratch.

 Many of the options described next apply only to ACTIVE KEB's.  It's not
 too hard to tell if a KEB is active or empty--An empty buffer will display
 no parameter values or envelope shapes.

 Whenever you enter an active KEB (or switch from one KEB to different,
 active KEB), the buffer data is sent to the S900 as a _separate program_,
 titled "*Work Buf*".  As mentioned earlier, this program is checksummed and
 re-sent to the sampler with each edit.  You use the right mouse button to
 "play" this program, allowing you to monitor the results of your editing.
 One caveat is that there must be enough room in the S900's program/keygroup
 memory to accommodate this temporary, one-keygroup program.  If things don't
 sound quite right as you are editing, make sure that the "*Work Buf*"
 program is present in the sampler, and is currently selected; if not,
 you'll have to make room by deleting one or two programs, keygroups, or
 samples from the S900's memory.

 KEB Management:

 At the bottom left of the screen are ten small boxes, representing the ten
 buffers.  The highlighted box is the current KEB (the one you're looking
 at).  A small inverted triangle directly above a box means that KEB is
 active and contains data.

   --Click on another box to move to that KEB.

   **<Shift>-clicking on another box copies the current KEB data to that
   KEB, if the current KEB is active.  If the target KEB is active, its data
   will be overwritten--There is no warning alert box or undoing possible.

   **<Control+Alt>-clicking on any box _other than the current KEB_ will
   clear that KEB if it's active.  Again, there is no warning alert or
   undoing possible, so this option should be used with care!

 There is only one keyboard equivalent to a mouse-controlled function in the
 S900 Companion, and it's here:  Pressing one of the ten function keys is
 equivalent to clicking in one of the ten small boxes.  This works in all
 three situations described above.

 The button labeled "INIT", in the bottom center of the screen, has multiple
 functions.  A simple click does what the label says--it initializes the
 current KEB (this would be the first step in creating a program from
 scratch).  The values default to those of the familiar "TONE PRGRM" (if the
 KEB is active, an alert box will ask you for confirmation before
 initializing the buffer; also, in the case of an active KEB, all values
 _except_ the sample assignments will be initialized).  If the current KEB
 is active, <SHIFT>- clicking on "INIT" brings up an alert box allowing you
 to clear the current KEB (<shift>-clicking in an empty KEB initializes it
 just as a simple click would). <Control+alt>- clicking on "INIT" brings up
 an alert box allowing you to clear _all ten_ KEB's.  This last operation
 can't be undone!

 "Owning" a KEB:

 At the upper left of the screen is a small box, divided into two halves
 labeled "CURR" and "COMP".  When one of these halves is highlighted, it
 means that the corresponding Main page program "owns" this KEB.  When you
 are done editing (you click on the <Done> or <Add> button at the bottom
 center of the screen), the data from this KEB is copied to whichever
 program owns this KEB.  The KEB's owner has implications for a few other
 operations which will be described later.

 Of course, an empty KEB will have no owner; if you initialize an empty KEB
 by clicking on "INIT", it is still not considered owned.  If you copy a
 keygroup from the Current or Composite program by <shift> or <alt>-clicking
 on it from one of the other two pages, then the owner will be set
 automatically.  If you copy the current KEB to another KEB, the copy will
 have the same owner.

 An active KEB's owner can be changed at any time by clicking in the
 appropriate half.  You could, for instance, copy a keygroup from the
 Current program, edit it, change its owner, and place it in the Composite
 program if you like.

 If a KEB is empty, clicking on "Curr" or "Comp" will initialize it and set
 its owner at the same time.

 Linked KEB's:

 As previously described, KEBs that contain keygroups copied from the
 Current or Composite programs are considered linked to the keygroups they
 were copied from.  The main implication of this are the two exit buttons at
 the bottom center of the Keygroup Edit page:  Clicking on the "Done" button
 copies the KEB data back to the Main page program, REPLACING the keygroup
 it was copied from--'linked' to.  Clicking on the "Add" button simply adds
 this keygroup data to the owner program, i.e., it becomes a new keygroup in
 the program.  This is the main difference between a linked and unlinked
 KEB:  An unlinked KEB may only be _added_ to the owner program.

 Although linking is an automatic process, you should keep the following in
 mind:  If a KEB is linked and you change its owner, the link is cancelled.
 If you change owners back to the original program, _without having added
 the KEB data to the new owner program_, the link is restored. (Once a KEB
 is added to the Current or Composite program, it's considered linked to the
 new keygroup in that program).  Now for the obvious stuff:  If you delete a
 keygroup from the Current or Composite program on the main page (or delete
 the entire program), then any KEB linked to that keygroup (or any keygroup
 in the deleted program) will be "unlinked".  If you load or request a new
 Current program, any KEB's with links to the previous Current program's
 keygroups will be unlinked. (As previously described under "Keygroup
 Operations", any such main page function will alert you if the operation
 involves any linked KEBs, giving you a chance to abort).

 Two incidental points:  If you swap the Current and Composite program on
 the main page, the S900 Companion will keep things in order:  All the KEBs'
 owners will also swap, and any links will be maintained.  Also, if you copy
 the current KEB to another KEB, and the current KEB is linked, the copy
 will be also be linked to the same keygroup in the owner program.

 The "Get Keygp" option:

 You can copy a keygroup from the Current or Composite program into the
 current KEB with this option button, located at the upper left of the
 screen.  If the KEB is empty, an alert box will first ask you which of the
 two programs you wish to get a keygroup from; then, a box will appear,
 listing the keygroups in that program. (If the KEB is active and already
 has an owner, you won't see this alert box--The keygroup list will be from
 the owner program.  Make sure the correct owner is highlighted before
 clicking on "Get Keygp").  Similar to the Main page, if there are more than
 17 keygroups in the program, arrows at the bottom of the box will allow
 access to keygroups 18-34.  Click on a keygroup to copy it into the current
 KEB, or anywhere else to abort.  Once copied, the current KEB is considered
 linked just as if you had copied it from the main page.

   **If the current KEB is active, its data will be overwritten by the
     chosen keygroup, with no warning alert or undoing possible.

 Parameter Editing:

 All editing is done with the mouse.  On/Off parameters are toggled by
 clicking on them.  The output is selected by clicking in one of the ten
 circles labeled 1-8, L (Left), R (Right), and M (Mix).  To change a sample
 assignment, click directly on the sample name.  The S900 Companion sends a
 "catalog request" message to the sampler and opens up a box with a list of
 the available samples.  Click on any displayed name to set a new sample, or
 anywhere else to leave things as they are.  Keep in mind that you may not
 hear the loud or soft sample depending on the settings for Velocity Switch
 Threshold and Velocity Crossfade.

 The remaining parameters are edited as follows:

 To _decrement_ a parameter, click anywhere from slightly to the left of the
 number (or on the hundredth's digit if present) to the tenth's digit. For
 key ranges, click anywhere from the key name to the space on its right
 (which may or may not contain a sharp sign).

 To _increment_, click anywhere from on the one's digit to slightly to the
 right of the number.  For key ranges, click anywhere from the octave number
 to slightly to the right of this.

 A single click will increment or decrement by one unit.  However, if you
 _continue to hold the left mouse button down_:

   1.  Keeping the mouse stationary, the value will begin scrolling slowly.

   2.  Moving the mouse further from the parameter will cause the scroll
       speed to increase.

   3.  Moving the mouse to the opposite side of the parameter will cause the
       scroll direction to reverse.

   4.  Clicking the right mouse button will cause the parameter value to be
       set to it's maximum or minimum, depending on whether you are
       incrementing or decrementing.

 Also, when editing a signed parameter, clicking directly on the sign will
 cause its value to be set to 0.  To decrement a signed parameter, start by
 clicking on the ten's digit.
 Envelope editing:

 Envelope values can be edited by clicking on the numbers under each
 envelope display box ("E.D. box" from now on) as described above, or by
 dragging the small boxes in the E.D. boxes to change the envelope shape.
 Note that you don't have to click directly on a small box--Anywhere in its
 vertical plane will "grab" it (as long as the mouse is within the E.D. box,
 of course).  The second small box controls the attack time, the third
 changes the decay and sustain, and the fourth controls the release time.

 Because the third small box changes both the decay and sustain times, it's
 quite possible to inadvertently change one parameter when you meant to edit
 the other.  While the mouse is in an E.D. box, press <d> to edit only the
 DECAY--The sustain parameter will be "locked".  Press <s> to edit the
 SUSTAIN only--The decay parameter will lock.  Press any other key to
 "unlock" (the mouse must be within the E.D. box for unlocking as well).
 Also, this feature applies only to click & drag-editing of the envelope
 shape; clicking on any of the numbers underneath the E.D. boxes to change
 their values will still work, locked or not.

 Note that, because the color monitor's vertical resolution is half that of
 the mono monitor, click & drag editing of the envelope sustain changes the
 value in units of two when using the color version of the S900 Companion.
 Of course you can set "in-between" values by clicking on the numbers under
 the E.D. boxes.

 Undoing and Shift-Editing:

 Pressing the <Undo> key on the ST's keyboard will undo the last edit.
 Repeated presses alternates between the two values, letting you compare
 values.

 Normally, every time you do an edit, the updated "*Work Buf*" program is
 immediately transmitted to the to the S900.  However, if you keep a shift
 key pressed as you edit, this program won't be sent to the sampler until
 you release it.  Then, the <Undo> key will undo the _entire group_ of edits
 that were made while the shift key was pressed.  As before, repeatedly
 pressing <Undo> lets you compare the previous and newly-edited values.

 Although you can edit as many parameters as you like with the shift key
 held, the Undo function will only remember the last _30_ edits.

 Note that editing with the shift key held is slightly faster since the S900
 Companion doesn't have to checksum and send the "*Work Buf*" program until
 you release the shift key.

 The Backup Buffer:

 The S900 Companion maintains an invisible backup KEB.  This buffer is reset
 whenever you move to the Keygroup Edit page, or move from one KEB to
 another.  When you first move into a KEB or initialize an empty KEB, its
 contents are automatically copied into this backup buffer.  At any point,
 if you click on the button labeled "BAK" (in the bottom middle of the
 screen), the current KEB will swap with the backup buffer.

 You can also copy the current KEB to the backup buffer at any point by
 <SHIFT>-clicking on the "BAK" button. (Incidentally, the backup buffer is
 not affected by initializing an active KEB.  If you <shift>-click on BAK
 _before you initialize_, you'll have a way to undo the initialization if
 you need to).

 _Individual parameters_ from the backup buffer can also be recalled. Press
 the <b> key and the mouse pointer shows a small letter "b" next to it.
 Normal editing is disabled; now, clicking on any parameter replaces the
 current value with that from the backup buffer (click once in either E.D.
 box to recall all envelope values at once).  Note that values are _not_
 swapped as when you click on "BAK", they are simply copied from the backup
 KEB.  However, you can use the <undo> key as in normal editing to recall
 and compare with the previous value.  Holding the <shift> key also works
 the same as in regular editing, allowing you to delay sending the new
 values until you release it, then letting you use the <undo> key to recall
 and compare all the values changed since the <shift> key was held down.

 Press the <b> key again to turn this feature off and return to normal
 editing.

 The <Done>, <Add>, and <Exit> buttons:

 As previously mentioned, the <Done> button assumes that this KEB is linked
 to a keygroup in the owner program.  In this case, the KEB data is copied
 back to the owner program, _replacing_ the keygroup it was copied from.
 This is the usual situation.  If you click on "Done" and the KEB isn't
 linked, you'll get an alert box allowing you to add the keygroup or abort.
 The <Add> button copies the current KEB to the program that owns this
 buffer.  The keygroup is _added_ to the program (space permitting- Remember
 that you can't have more than 29 keygroups in a program).  If this KEB
 isn't owned, an alert box will ask you to choose the program you wish to
 add this keygroup to (Current or Composite), or abort.  Once added, the KEB
 is considered linked to the new keygroup in the owner program, regardless
 of its previous link status.

 The <Exit> button takes you back to the Main or Output Map page (depending
 on which of those pages you accessed the Keygroup Edit page from) without
 doing anything.

 <Shift>-clicking on <Done> or <Add> is equivalent to clicking that button,
 then clicking on <Exit>.  The KEB will be copied to the owner program and
 you'll exit the Keygroup Edit page.

 At the risk of repeating myself needlessly, please remember that the edited
 program exists in the S900 Companion, NOT the S900 itself.  In order to
 save your work you MUST transmit this program to the sampler by selecting
 "Send Program" from the "File" menu (or pressing the space bar) on the main
 page, as detailed previously.  Of course, the program should then be saved
 on the S900's own disk.

 If the owner program does not exist, the S900 Companion assumes that you
 are creating one.  When you return to the Main page, you'll see that you
 now have a program, called "*Untitled*", with the keygroup you were just
 editing.  You may want to rename this program to something a little more
 descriptive before sending it to the sampler!

 RIGHT MOUSE PLAY

 The S900 Companion doesn't currently support a midi thru function, so the
 only way to monitor the results of your editing is to use this feature,
 which operates only on the Keygroup Edit page (and only if the current KEB
 is active).  Pressing the right mouse button sends a note-on; releasing it
 sends the note-off.  With simple right-mouse clicks, the pitch of the note
 is determined by the mouse's horizontal position on the screen.  The
 particular note sent depends on the key range programmed in the current
 KEB.  For example, if the low and high notes of the Key Range parameter are
 the same, then the same note will be sent no matter where the mouse is on
 the screen.  If the key range spans 3 semitones, the note sent is
 determined by which 'third' of the screen the mouse pointer is in.
 However, if you hold a shift key as you click the right mouse button, the
 note sent will always be the midpoint of the key range no matter where the
 mouse is on the screen.

 The velocity value sent is determined by the mouse's vertical position.
 Higher velocity values are sent with the mouse nearer the top of the
 screen.  This value can also be overridden by keeping the <alt> key pressed
 as you right-click; in this case, a velocity value of 127 will be sent no
 matter where the mouse is on the screen.

 Note that the settings for Velocity Switch Point and Velocity Crossfade,
 along with the mouse's position on the screen, will affect what you hear as
 you right-click.

 THE PARAMETER EDIT BUFFERS ("PEB's")

 Under the small box labeled "Get Keyg" is one labeled "Parm Edits".  This
 is one of the most powerful features of the S900 Companion, allowing for
 flexible and creative editing of S900 programs.  A Parameter Edit Buffer
 ("PEB" from now on) is a place were individual parameters' values are
 copied into, to be later pasted into other KEB's or the Current or
 Composite program keygroups.  The S900 Companion has three such buffers,
 indicated by the three selections shown:  "Copy" (Copy Parameter), "Cond"
 (Conditional Edit), and "All" (All Keygroup).  Each buffer holds up to 30
 parameters' values.

   --Values placed into the "Copy Parameter" buffer can be pasted into any
     active KEB at any time.

   --Values in the "All Keygroup" buffer are pasted into all keygroups of
     either the Current or Composite program.

   --The "Conditional Edit" buffer doesn't do any editing per se; rather, it
     can control the pasting from the other two buffers.

 The All Keygroup and Copy Parameter buffers operate similarly. There are
 two ways to place values into these buffers:

  1.  AS YOU EDIT.  Press the <a> or <c> keys on the ST's keyboard.  The
      mouse pointer will show a small letter "a" or "c" next to it,
      indicating that each time you do an edit, the resulting value will be
      placed in the All Keygroup or Copy Parameter buffer.  Press the same
      key again to turn this function off. _Editing itself is not affected
      in any way_.

  2.  <Control>-click ('C'ontrol= Copy Parameters) or <Alt>-click ('A'lt=
      All Keygroups) on a parameter; the current value is placed in the
      respective PEB.  The parameter value will flash to confirm this.  No
      editing takes place. <Control> or <alt>-clicking on _any_ output (even
      "between the circles") places the current output selection in the
      PEB.

 The second method has priority over the first; for example, even if the
 mouse pointer shows the small "c" indicating edits will be placed in the
 "Copy Parameter" PEB, Alt-clicking on a parameter will place it's value in
 the "All Keygroup" PEB (and vice-versa).

 As mentioned, each buffer can hold up to 30 values.  You'll get an alert
 box warning you if this limit has been reached.  Also, only one value for
 any one parameter can exist in a PEB; if, for instance, you place the VCA
 Attack time in a PEB, then later change it and place it in the same PEB,
 the first value will be discarded.
 There is a shortcut for placing existing envelope values in the PEB's:
 <Control> or <Alt>-clicking anywhere in an E.D. box will place all the
 envelope values in the Copy Parameter or All Keygroup PEB (respectively) at
 once.  Doing this with the filter envelope copies the "Amount" parameter as
 well as the four envelope time values.  The E.D. box will flash to
 confirm.

 The Conditional Edit Buffer:

 This PEB is different from the other two.  Like the others, you can store
 up to 30 parameters' values in it.  These values are not pasted anywhere,
 however; instead, they are compared with the values for the same parameters
 in the current KEB (when pasting from the Copy Parameter buffer) or
 Current/Composite program keygroup (when pasting from the All Keygroups
 buffer).  Depending on settings you make in the PEB edit box (detailed
 shortly), the pastes can be made to happen or not depending on if the
 parameter values match.  This is "conditional editing".

 There is only one way to place values into the Conditional Edit Buffer:
 Press the <o> key on the ST's keyboard.  The small letters "co" will appear
 next to the mouse pointer.  Normal editing is disabled.  Now, click on any
 parameter to place its value in the Conditional PEB (as before, clicking in
 either envelope box places all envelopes values in the buffer at once).
 Press the <o> key again to turn this function off and return to normal
 editing.

 Using the PEB's:

 A simple click on "Copy" or "All" pastes the values from the respective PEB
 into the current KEB (Copy), or the keygroups of the owner program (All).
 Clicking on "Cond" is different; in this case, you are just toggling
 Conditional editing on and off ("Cond" will highlight when Conditional
 editing is on).  This is a "master switch".  In addition, Conditional
 editing is switched on and off separately for Copy Parameter or All
 Keygroup pastes; this is done in the PEB edit box, described next.

 The pasting operations are explained in more detail further in this
 documentation.

 The PEB Edit Box:

 <SHIFT>-clicking on "Copy", "Cond", or "All" brings up the Parameter Edit
 Buffer Edit box for the respective PEB, where you can view all the
 parameter values and change, delete, or copy them to the other two buffers.
 In addition, all three PEB edit boxes have switches that control the
 operation of the Conditional edit buffer.  Parameter values can also be
 saved to disk for future use!

 The left side of the box will list the parameters in the buffer by name,
 along with their current values.  If there are more than 15, a small
 downward-pointing arrow will appear at the bottom of the list.  Click there
 to see the remaining ones; the arrow will change to point upwards.  Click
 on the arrow again to return to the first display, and so on.

 All functions except for "Edit" operate only on _selected_ parameters. Like
 selecting keygroups on the main page, you click on a parameter to select it
 (its text will highlight), and click on a selected one to de- select it.
 The "Select All" button is a shortcut for doing exactly that, while the
 "Deselect" button quickly de-selects all selected parameters.

 The major functions of the PEB edit box are controlled by the five buttons
 on the bottom:

 **DELETE: This option deletes all _selected_ edits (no undo).

 --EXIT: Closes the PEB edit box and returns you to the current KEB.

 --SAVE: Parameter values can be saved for future use.  This could come in
   handy, if for example, you've come up with some specific settings for
   values that you might want to apply to other keygroups in the future.
   Clicking here opens a file selector for saving the _selected_ edits.
   Files are saved with the extension ".S9E" ("S900 Edit").

 **LOAD: This option brings up a file selector allowing you to load files
   saved with the previous option.  Files saved from any of the three PEB's
   can be loaded back into any of them (i.e., edits saved from the Copy
   Parameter buffer can be loaded into the All Keygroup buffer, etc.).  The
   edits being loaded will _replace_ any edits in the PEB you are loading
   them into (all existing edits will be lost).

 --EDIT: This option allows you to "edit the edits"(!).  If you click here,
   the PEB edit box will close, and it will appear that you are back to
   editing the KEB.  This is not the case; note that the only parameters
   displayed are those from the PEB.  You use the mouse similarly to editing
   a KEB, only now you are editing the values in the PEB! (Also note that
   envelope parameters are displayed numerically, not graphically, and must
   be edited as such).  Right-mouse play and all other non-editing functions
   are disabled on this sub-page.

 Note that the five buttons at the bottom of the KEB screen are changed; the
 two larger buttons, now labeled "PEB" and "KEB" are the two exit buttons:

  --PEB (Parameter Edit Buffer)-Click here to return to the PEB edit box.

  --KEB (Keygroup Edit Buffer)-Click here to return to regular keygroup
    editing.

 As mentioned on the screen, a simple click in either of these two boxes
 accepts any changes you have made to the PEB values.  <SHIFT>-clicking
 cancels the changes and keeps the PEB values as they were before you
 started editing them.

 Copying parameter values to other PEB's:

 This feature lets you move parameter values between the three PEB's and is
 controlled by the four buttons on the upper right of the PEB edit box. To
 implement this, highlight one of the two buttons on the left, then choose
 the PEB you wish to copy to (the "target" PEB) by clicking on one of the
 two buttons on the right:

 --Copy To (R): "R" means _replace_.  Any edits currently in the target PEB
   will be deleted, and replaced with the selected edits from the current
   PEB.

 --Copy To (A): "A" means _add_.  The selected edits are added to any edits
   already in the target PEB (The total number of resulting edits in the
   target PEB must be 30 or less).

 When adding edits, if the same parameter exists in the target buffer, its
 value will be replaced by the value in the current PEB.  An alert box will
 warn you of this and give you a chance to abort.

 The Conditional Edit Switches:

 Four buttons control the Conditional Edit buffer's operation.  The upper
 two enable and disable Conditional editing for the Copy Parameter and All
 Keygroups PEB's.  If the corresponding box is highlighted, AND the "master
 switch" ("Cond") on the Keygroup Edit page is also highlighted, then
 Conditional editing will be in effect for any pastes done from that
 buffer.

 If Conditional editing is enabled, The lower two buttons determine whether
 the pastes will happen or not:

 --PASTE: The target keygroup is examined to see if its values match those
   in the Conditional Edit PEB.  The paste will occur _only if the values
   match_.

 --PASTE NOT: As you might expect, the opposite action.  If the values
   match, the paste will NOT occur; otherwise, it will.

 These are radio buttons; only one condition can be in effect, and it
 applies to pastes from both of the other PEBs.

 Pasting values from the Copy Parameter buffer:

 To paste the Copy Parameter buffer values into the current KEB, click on
 "Copy" in the "Parm Edits" box.  If this PEB is empty, a small message box
 will pop up briefly to tell you.  Otherwise, a message box saying
 "Pasting..." will pop up.  If Conditional editing is in effect for the Copy
 Parameter buffer (and the "master switch" is highlighted), the values in
 the Conditional PEB are compared with the same parameters in the current
 KEB.  If the values match and "Paste" is highlighted in the PEB Edit box,
 OR if the values _don't_ match, and "Paste NOT" is highlighted, the paste
 will occur.  In this case, "** Done **" will appear in the message box.  If
 the values _don't_ match and "Paste" is highlighted, OR if they _do_ match
 and "Paste NOT" is set, the pastes will NOT occur, and the word "** NOT **"
 will appear in the message box.

 If Conditional editing is not enabled, then the paste(s) will occur
 regardless of any values in the Conditional PEB and "** Done **" will
 appear in the message box.

 If the pastes occur, the screen will update to show the new values, and the
 *Work Buf* program is updated and sent to the S900.  As with regular
 editing, the <Undo> key will now restore (and, with repeated presses, allow
 comparisons with) the values previous to the paste.

 Pasting values from the All Keygroups buffer:

 To paste the All Keygroup buffer values into every keygroup of the Current
 or Composite program, click on "All" in the "Parm Edits" box.  The pastes
 will be done to _whichever program owns the current KEB_.  Because there is
 NO undoing possible, an alert box will confirm your action before the
 pastes happen.

 The same "Paste/Paste NOT" conditions relating to Conditional editing for
 the Copy Parameter PEB apply, except that the values in the Conditional PEB
 are compared with _each keygroup_ of the owner program.  This means that
 the parameter values may be pasted into some keygroups and not others. (For
 example, if the Conditional PEB has output #8 as a value, and "PASTE" is
 highlighted in the PEB Edit Box, then the values from the All Keygroup PEB
 will be pasted only into keygroups of the owner program that are set to
 output #8; if "PASTE NOT" is highlighted, the values will be pasted into
 all keygroups _except_ those that are set to output #8).  The same message
 box will pop up with the message "Pasting...".  As each keygroup is
 examined, a "+" will appear if the paste occurs, or a "-" if not.  If
 Conditional editing is off, you will see only "+" symbols since the values
 will be pasted into every keygroup of the owner program.

 Note that two parameters, "Keyboard Tilt" (which controls the loudness of
 all keygroups as you play up the keyboard), and "Positional Crossfade"
 (which allows overlapping keygroups to fade in and out) are NOT
 keygroup-specific; If either of these parameters are in the All Keygroup
 PEB, they will be pasted into the owner program _regardless of any settings
 of the Conditional PEB_.

 Edits are pasted one at a time into every keygroup.  The "+" and "-"
 symbols will cycle through each keygroup for each edit.  This process may
 take a few seconds if the program contains many keygroups and there are a
 lot of values in the All Keygroup PEB to paste.

 Quick-clearing the PEB's:

 **Similar to the small KEB boxes, <Control>+<Alt>-clicking on "Copy",
   "Cond" or "All" will empty the respective buffer, with no warning alert
   or undoing possible.  This feature is available only in an active KEB.

 Comments:

 Clicking on this box (underneath the owner boxes) opens up a message box
 allowing you to type in a short line of text.  If the current KEB has no
 comment, you'll see a text cursor at the beginning of the line and you can
 start typing.  If a comment already exists, you'll need to click somewhere
 on the comment line to place the cursor there before you can enter or edit
 text (or, pressing <Clr/Home> erases any existing comment and puts the
 cursor at the beginning of the line).  Existing text will be "typed over"
 by any new text you enter.  The <Insert> key opens up a space at the cursor
 location (existing text is pushed right; text at the end of the line is
 lost).  The <Delete> and <Backspace> keys will do their thing, and the
 arrow keys on the ST's cursor pad move you through the text (left & right
 arrow keys move back & forth; up arrow puts you at the beginning and down
 arrow at the end of the line).

 Pressing <return> or clicking the mouse anywhere outside the message box
 exits.

 The S900 Companion has a fair amount of code devoted to writing its own
 comments!  This feature is designed to help you keep track of which Main
 page program/keygroup the current KEB is linked to.  Whenever a keygroup
 from a Main page program is copied into a KEB, the comment line will
 contain its owner (Current or Composite), the owner program's name, and the
 number of the keygroup the KEB is linked to.  If you leave this comment
 line alone, the S900 Companion will automatically update it to keep it in
 sync with whatever you do on the Main page.  If you edit the comment line
 in any way, though, it will remain as is no matter what you do on the Main
 page (unless you clear the KEB, or copy a new main page keygroup into it).

 OTHER STUFF

 The "S900C.DAT" File:

 When you quit the S900 Companion, the standard "Are You Sure" dialog will
 have an extra button marked "Save.DAT".  Clicking there saves a file called
 S900C.DAT before the program terminates.  Essentially, this is a "snapshot"
 of all the data in the S900 Companion.  The program looks for this file
 when it runs, and automatically loads it if found, restoring everything to
 where it was before you quit.  This feature is designed for when the
 program is run from within a sequencer.  Many sequencers have the ability
 to run a different program from within them.  Two examples are Dr T's "MPE"
 and Barefoot Software's "Hybri-switch".  The disadvantage of these systems
 is that all data in the different program is lost when returning to the
 sequencer.  By saving this .DAT file, you'll be able to switch in and out
 of the S900 Companion from your sequencer, other program (or even the
 desktop!) and retain the following data:

 --Both the Current and Composite programs, and their keygroup selection
   statuses.

 --The contents of all ten KEBs, their owners, and link statuses.

 --Comments for the ten KEBs.

 --The contents of the three Parameter Edit Buffers.

 --The Conditional Edit settings (the "master switch" and individual enables
   for the Copy Parameter and All Keygroup PEB's).

 --The current basic midi channel (the channel check-marked under the "Midi
   Chan" menu.

 The S900C.DAT file is saved to the directory path specified in the
 "Preferences" menu option (setting this path to a ramdisk will speed things
 up considerably and is recommended).  As soon as the file is saved, you'll
 quit the program.  If a file selector appears, it means the disk doesn't
 have enough room to store the .DAT file.  Use the selector to change to a
 suitable disk and directory and click on "OK" (it isn't necessary to enter
 any file name). The .DAT file will be saved there and you'll quit the S900
 Companion.

 **If you click on "Cancel" in this file selector, it's assumed you don't
   care about saving a .DAT file and you'll exit the program immediately,
   losing all your data!
 You can load a .DAT file at any point by selecting "Load .DAT File" under
 the "File" menu.  This would need to be done if you had to save the file to
 a different disk/directory than specified in the "Preferences" option as
 described in the previous paragraph.  Of course, loading a .DAT file will
 overwrite _all_ current data in the S900 Companion (selecting "Cancel" in
 the file selector aborts but as an extra measure an alert box will confirm
 the load).

 The automatic loading of the .DAT file can be disabled by holding a <shift>
 key while the S900 Companion boots.

 Online Help:

 Pressing the <Help> key (on either the main page or the keygroup edit page)
 brings up a message box with a list of help topics.  Use the mouse to
 select one, or click anywhere else to cancel. The help feature uses this
 doc file; the S900 companion will look for this file in the path specified
 under the "Preferences" option, described next.  If this file is not found,
 a file selector will appear; change to the proper disk/directory and click
 on "OK").  Some of the topics use more than one screen; you'll be prompted
 to press the arrow keys on the ST's cursor pad for these.  As indicated,
 pressing <Esc> quits help.

 Preferences:

 Selecting this menu item (under the "File" menu) brings up a dialog box
 letting you choose the directory paths for the various S900 Companion file
 types.  The selected paths, along with several other parameters, can be
 saved to a file named "S900C.PRF", which the S900 Companion will look for
 and load when it's run.

 The three paths shown are:

 --Program/PEB Path: The S900 Companion will use this path to load and save
   .S9P (S900 program) and .S9E (S900 edits, for the PEBs) files.

 --S900C.DOC Path: This should be the directory containing THIS file, which
   is used by the on-line Help feature.  Setting this path to a ramdisk (and
   copying this file to it, of course) will speed up the Help feature, since
   portions of this doc file are loaded each time a help topic is chosen. (A
   hard drive is pretty quick too, but if you only have a floppy drive you
   should consider using a ramdisk if you're accessing Help a lot).

 --S900C.DAT Path: As detailed earlier, setting this path to a ramdisk will
   make using the S900 Companion from a sequencer much faster, since the
   .DAT file is loaded & saved each time you enter/exit the S900 Companion
   from the sequencer.

 To change paths, click on the path name and a file selector will appear.
 Move to the disk/directory you want, and click on "OK" (it's not necessary
 to select a file) to set this path as current, or "Cancel" to keep it as it
 was.  If a path is more than a few folders deep, the entire path name may
 not be displayed.

 Clicking on the "Save" button creates the S900C.PRF file and saves it to
 the same directory that the S900 Companion was run from (a previously saved
 S900C.PRF file in this directory will be overwritten).  From now on, the
 paths specified will be set automatically every time the program is run.
 Click on "Exit" to get out of this dialog box.
 The current Conditional edit settings (master switch, and individual
 enables for the Copy Parameter and All keygroups PEBs), along with the
 current basic midi channel, are also saved in this file (note that, since
 the S900C.DAT file also includes the basic midi channel, and is loaded
 after the .PRF file, the midi channel specified in the .DAT file will take
 precedence).

 Using desk accessories:

 The S900 companion is programmed in GFA Basic 2.0.  This programming
 language makes a lot of things easy.  Using desk accessories isn't one of
 them!  Unfortunately, I am not knowledgeable enough in the area of GEM
 programming to incorporate the use of desk accessories in a "pretty" way.
 Rather than disable them, however, I've left them active.  You'll see what
 I mean when you use one:  The screen will be corrupted with the desk
 accessory.  What I've come up with to deal with this is a simple way to
 re-draw the S900 Companion screen when you're finished with the accessory:
 Simply move the mouse to the BOTTOM of the screen, and click.
