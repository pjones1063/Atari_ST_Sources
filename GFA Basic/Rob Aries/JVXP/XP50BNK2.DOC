OVERVIEW
========

The JV/XP Manager is a program for Atari ST computers to manage and
organize user patches and performances on the Roland JV/XP series of
synthesizers.  The program reserves space or two sets (banks) of patches
and the performances that use them--a total of 256 patches and 64
performances.  Patches/perfs. can be copied or moved within and between
banks at will.  The JV/XP Manager can keep performances and patches "in
sync" by automatically updating performances when the patches they use are
moved or copied to other locations.  In addition, the program features
search and replace functions that let you "mark" patches/perfs. by criteria
you specify, and perform batch operations on them.  These operations
include copying, deleting, name-marking, saving, sending to the synth, and
parameter editing.  Patches/perfs. can also be sent to the synth's
temporary memory for auditioning.

This program runs in ST high resolution (640x400) only.


SETUP
=====

The JV/XP Manager can operate stand-alone (if using previously saved .SYX
files), however you may want to hear what you're doing (!), and you may
want to request or send patches to and from the synth.  You should be
connected from the Atari's midi out to the synth's midi in to audition and
send patches to the synth; additionally, you'll need a connection from the
synth's midi out to the Atari's midi in if you plan to request patches
from the synth.

The JV/XP Manager has an "intelligent thru" function that lets you
audition patches and performances from a master keyboard; this will make
setup a bit trickier if you want to keep full 2-way communication with the
synth.  A midi merge box or a midi interface with merging capability
should be used, connected like this:

      MASTER KEYBOARD-(out)->-----|
                                  \/
                                 (in 1)
                              |--------|            |-------|
                              | MERGER |(out)-->(in)| ATARI |
                              |--------|            |-------|
                                 (in 2)                 (out)
                                  /\                     \/
      SYNTH (out)--->-------------|                      |
             (in)---<----------------------<-------------|


A master keyboard may have its own merging capability; in that case,
connect it like so:

      MASTER KEYBOARD-(out)-->-----(in) SYNTH (out)-->---|
            (in)                                         |
              /\                                         |
              |----<---(out) ATARI (in)----<--------<----|

If you have an XP-50/80, be sure that "soft thru", selected on the
SYSTEM:SEQ MODE page, is turned OFF, otherwize a midi feedback loop will
occur.


OPERATION
=========

When you run the program, the screen will be filled with four boxes.
The two large ones on either side hold user patches ("patch boxes"), and
the two smaller ones in the middle of the screen hold user performances
("performance boxes").  The patch box on the left, along with the
performance box on the top, comprise the "source bank"; the other two
boxes hold the "destination bank".  The source bank is empty, while the
destination bank is filled with "Init." (initialized) patches and
performances.  The names "source" and "destination" are mostly to
distinguish the two banks; any function in the JV/XP Manager can be
applied to either bank, except "Batch copy".

Since there is no room for a menu bar, a "pop-up" menu is used.  This is
activated by RIGHT-clicking the mouse.  The menu works as you would
expect; highlight and click a selection with the mouse, or click anywhere
outside the menu box to clear the menu from the screen.

Options selected through the menu can vary depending on whether they're
applied to patches or performances.  Generally, these options are applied
to *whichever box the mouse is in when you right-click* (note that the
menu won't be called up if you right-click with the mouse *between*
boxes!).  Also, several options will operate differently if you hold a
<shift> key as you right- click.  These differences are noted when each
specific option is discussed.

GETTING PATCHES & PERFORMANCES INTO THE JV/XP MANAGER
=====================================================

User patches and performances can be loaded from an existing disk file
(.SYX, or "midiex" format), requested from the synth, or received from the
synth when you initiate a bulk dump from its front panel.  The JV/XP
Manager also lets you request ROM patches/perfs.

Loading .SYX files

With the mouse pointer in either the patch or performance box of the bank
you want to load the file into, right-click to call up the menu.  Click on
"Load .SYX file", and use the fileselector to choose the file to load.
The JV/XP Manager examines each individual sysex message within the file,
and routes it to the appropriate box.  Sysex messages other than user
patches or performances are ignored. (While many sysex files consist of a
single type of message, Roland messages can be combinations of performance,
patch, system, rhythm, and scale tune.  Even single types of messages, such
as a patch or performance, consist of five or more individual sysex
strings).  An alert warns if you would overwrite an existing patch or
performance; if you abort, all further loading of that type (patch or perf)
message is cancelled.  If you choose to go ahead, all following messages of
that type will be loaded even if they overwrite existing patches/perfs.
(The <Undo> key can retrieve any existing patches or performances that
are overwritten).

If you get the warning alert, and abort the load, you may notice a delay
before you can continue working; this is because the program will continue
to search through the file in case there are other types of sysex messages
that can be loaded.


UNDO/REDO
=========

The <Undo> key will undo any destructive operation (i.e., one that
overwrites or alters data).  Pressing the <Undo> key repeatedly lets you
compare the edited and original data.  The undo function remembers only
the LAST destructive edit operation.


SELECTING, COPYING, MOVING, AND AUDITIONING PATCHES & PERFORMANCES
==================================================================

The following operations can be performed directly from the main screen
of the program without using the menu:

A simple left-click on a patch or performance name SELECTS it (the name
highlights).  Clicking on a selected name de-selects it.  Keeping the
left mouse button down while sliding the mouse over names selects or
deselects additional patches/performances.  Most of the JV/XP Manager
functions are applied only to selected patches/perfs.  I call this
selection method "manual"--*you* pick the patches or performances you
want to work with.  Most of the power of the JV/XP Manager comes from its
"automatic" selection functions, which are contained within several dialog
boxes, and described further in this documentation.  Manual selection is a
good way to apply operations to patches/perfs. that you can identify by
simply seeing their name on the screen.

<Shift>-clicking on a patch or performance name sends it to the synth's
temporary memory for AUDITIONING.  If you <shift>-click on a
*performance*, it's examined to see if it uses a user patch; if so, that
patch can be sent to the synth's temporary performance part memory (the
patch sent will be from the same bank as the performance).  Whether user
patches are sent with performances is determined by settings made in the
DEFAULTS dialog box.  This dialog is accessed from the menu and is
described in the next section.  The JV/XP Manager defaults to *always*
sending user patches from a performance.

(Sending user patches along with performances can slow things down.  If
you're auditioning many performances that use a lot of user patches, you
may want to send the bank of patches to the synth and setting the default
for sending user patches to *never*; this will speed things up, as the
performance sent will reference patches already in the synth.  Of course,
you should back up the existing user patches in the synth before sending
the patches from the JV/XP Manager!).

The synth can be played from a master keyboard connected to the Atari's
midi in port, or from the synth's own keyboard if you have an XP50/80.
The JV/XP Manager has an "intelligent thru" function that makes
auditioning patches and performances from an external keyboard convenient.
Intelligent thru is enabled in the DEFAULTS dialog, and described in the
section "MENU FUNCTIONS: Defaults."

COPYING a single patch/perf is done by <control>-clicking on a name;
continue to hold the mouse button and "drag" the name to the new location.
Both selected or non-selected patches can be copied; if selected, the copy
will be also.  Patches/perfs can be copied to the opposing bank, or within
the same bank.  Copying a patch to a performance box or vice-versa has no
effect, and is a good way to abort if you've already <control>-clicked on
a name.  Of course, copying to a location that already holds a patch or
performance will cause it to be overwritten by the patch/perf you're
copying (the <Undo> key will undo & redo this).

If a group of patches/perfs are selected, <control>+<left shift>-clicking
on one of the selected names lets you copy the entire group of patches/
perfs at once.  Only contiguously selected patches/perfs are affected.  As
with single patches/perfs, you can copy to the opposing bank or within the
same bank (even overlapping the original source locations).  Again, the
<Undo> key restores things to where they where before the copy operation.

MOVING a patch or performance is the same as copying, except that the
source patch/perf slot is cleared (deleted) after the copy is made.
Moving only works *within* a patch or performance box (i.e., the same
bank).  The <Undo> key will restore the deleted patch/perf as well as the
patch/perf that was copied over.  To move a single patch/perf, <control>+
<alt> click on the name.  To move a group of selected patches/perfs,
<shift>+<alt>- click on one of the selected names.

When *patches* are moved or copied within the SAME bank, the JV/XP
Manager can examine all the *performances* in that bank to see if any of
them use the moved/copied patches.  If so, the performances can be edited
to point to the new locations of these patches.  This depends on settings
you make in the DEFAULTS dialog box.  I call this "updating" the
performances.  The JV/XP Manager initially defaults to updating
performances only when patches are MOVED.  Undoing a copy/move also undoes
any updates to performances.

When a *performance* is copied *from one bank to the other*, the XP/JV
Manager looks to see if it uses any user patches; if so, they can be
copied as well; the copied performance is then edited to point to the
newly-copied patch location(s).  Again, settings in the DEFAULTS dialog
will determine if these patch copies are done.  Patches are copied to the
first available location, which can be an "Init Patch" or an empty slot.
Several conditions can prevent a performance and/or its associated user
patches from being copied, causing one or two alert boxes to appear;
these are discussed in the section entitled "ERRORS."

To summarize:

click:                    Select/deselect
<shift>-click:            Audition patch/perf

<control>-click:          Copy single patch/perf
<control>-<alt>-click:    Move single patch/perf (within banks only)
<control>+<shift>-click:  Copy multiple selected patches/perfs
<shift>+<alt>-click:      Move multiple selected patches/perfs (within
                            banks only)

In addition to "manual" copying/moving, the JV/XP Manager has a "batch
copy" function.  This operation, described later, can quickly copy all
selected patches & performances, with several options on how and where the
copies are made.  However, this function works only FROM the *source* TO
the *destination bank*; "manual" copying/moving works in both directions.


MENU FUNCTIONS
==============

As mentioned earlier, most of these functions perform differently
depending on where the mouse pointer is BEFORE you right-click to call up
the menu, and if a <shift> key is held when you right-click.  How this
affects operations is detailed in the descriptions of each function:

Load .SYX file

This option is discussed above, in the section "Getting patches and
performances into the XP/JV Manager."

Save .SYX file

This option is "box"-specific; for example, if you right-click in the
source bank PATCH box, the resulting .SYX file will consist of only the
PATCHES from that bank.  Holding the <shift> key as you call up the menu
causes this option to be "bank" specific; both patches AND performances
from the bank you right-clicked in will be saved to the .SYX file.

  Important: If none of the patches/perfs in a box are selected, then ALL
  the patches/perfs will be saved; otherwize, ONLY the selected patches/
  perfs will be saved.

Selections...

Box-specific.  This brings up a dialog box with five options to apply to
selected patches/perfs.  Choose one by highlighting its button, then
click the "OK" button.  The options are:

 "Deselect" -- what it says!  Careful, this is NOT undoable! (of course,
      it doesn't really alter the data either).

 "Reverse" -- Selected patches are deselected; non-selected patches are
      selected.

 "Initialize" -- selected patches/perfs are replaced by "Init. Patch" or
      "Init. Perf" patches/perfs.

 "Clear" -- Selected patches/perfs are erased, removing them from the
      bank.

 "Mark name" -- Type some characters in the field next to this button;
      they will be placed into the names of all selected patches/perfs.
      Character positions with the underscore ("_") are left unchanged.
      This feature is useful for "marking" patches/perfs so they can be
      identified when on a gig or otherwize away from the computer.

The last three operations can be undone.

Batch Copy...

This function copies ALL selected patches or performances from the source
to the destination bank in one step.  For this option, it doesn't matter
where the mouse is when you call up the menu.  A dialog box appears with
several choices.  Highlight the small box to the left of your choice, then
click "OK" to copy or "Cancel" to abort.  The copied patches/perfs will be
selected in the destination bank.

 "Copy patches" -- Copies all selected source bank patches to the
      destination bank.

 "Copy performances" -- Same thing with the performances.

 "Copy performances and associated user patches" -- As each selected
      performance is copied, it's examined to see if it uses any user
      patches.  If so, those patches are also copied from the source to
      the destination bank.

Only one of the above three options can be active during a batch copy
operation.  One of the following two choices must also be selected:

 "Copy to: First available locations" -- Each patch/perf is copied to the
      first empty or "Init." patch/perf slot.  If you chose "Copy
      performances and associated user patches", the copied performance is
      edited to point to the new patch locations in the destination bank.
      The <Undo> key will undo/redo this operation.

 "Copy to: Same numbers" -- Each patch/perf is copied to the same location
      in the destination bank.  This may overwrite existing patches/perfs
      in the destination bank; the <Undo> key will restore them.

It's possible to get into trouble when copying performances' associated
user patches.  As mentioned earlier, a performance references a patch
only by number; it doesn't care what specific patch is at a location.  If
you copy or move patches to different locations, or load or request new
patches into a bank, you could wind up with performances that reference
the wrong patches!  While the JV/XP Manager can "update" a performance if
a patch is moved or copied to a new location within a bank, it won't
help you if the patch you're *copying over* is also used in a performance!
(The JV/XP Manager can "mark" all the patches used by performances to help
you avoid this, though).

  IMPORTANT:  The JV/XP Manager keeps track of *patches* that are copied
  *from one bank to the other*, either manually or by using the "Batch
  Copy" function.  The reason for this is to prevent duplicate copies of a
  patch when *copying a performance and associated patches to the first
  available locations* (either manually--from one bank to the other--or
  with the Batch Copy function).  The program "marks" the patch being
  copied and remembers where it was copied to in the opposing bank.  If a
  copied performance uses a "marked" patch, this performance is simply
  edited to point to the location of the already-copied patch.  The patch
  remains "marked" until another patch is loaded, requested, or copied
  into that location.  You can also "unmark" all patches in one step by
  holding the <shift> key as you right-click to call up the menu, and
  select "Copy performances and associated user patches" (an alert box
  will confirm this action).  This alert appears *only* if "Copy
  performances and associated user patches" is selected.  To un-mark all
  patch locations without doing any copying, simply call up this function
  with NO performances selected.

  Note that you can still copy any patch, "marked" or not, multiple times,
  both within and between banks.  Multiple copying of marked patches is
  prevented ONLY in the two situations mentioned above: manually copying a
  performance from one bank to the other with "copy a performance's
  associated user patches" enabled in the defaults dialog, OR using the
  Batch Copy function to copy *performances and associated user patches*
  to the *first available* locations.

Depending on what you're doing, you may see one or more of the following
alert boxes during a batch copy operation:

"One or more patch (performance) could not be copied, as there are no
more patch (performance) slots available".  This alert would come up only
if you were copying to the "first available" locations, and should be
self-explanatory (I hope!): there are not enough empty or "Init."
patches/performances in the destination bank to hold the number of
patches or performances being copied from the source bank.

You may see the following alerts when copying a performance and its
associated user patches, either manually or with the Batch Copy function:

"One or more performance could not be copied, as there was no space for
their associated patches".  This means that the bank being copied to does
not have enough empty or "Init." patch locations to copy the needed number
of a performance's associated patches to.  When copying a performance and
its associated patches to the first available locations, the JV/XP Manager
always makes sure there are enough available patch locations before copying
the performance.

"One or more patches for the performance being copied does not exist!".
This means that the user patch number in the performance points to an
empty slot in the bank of patches; the possible reasons for this are that
you deleted the patch, or you simply haven't loaded or requested the
patches that go along with the performance(s) you're copying.  The three
exit buttons in this alert box are:

  "Abort"--Stop the entire operation, even if there are more performances
   to copy.

  "Next"--Skip this performance, go on to the next one (if there are more
   left to copy).  You may get the alert again.

  "Continue"--Keep looking through this performance, copying any user
   patches that DO exist, and skipping those that don't; then go on to the
   next performance.  You may get the alert again.

Send patches/performances...

This option is box-specific, or by <shift>-right clicking to call up the
menu, bank-specific.  As the confirming alert says, only the *selected*
patches or performances will be sent to the synth, unless there are NO
selected patches/perfs in a box; in that case, ALL the patches/perfs are
sent.  Of course, the sent data will overwrite the corresponding locations
in the synth (empty locations in JV/XP Manager banks will not affect
data at the same locations in the synth).  Note that the "memory protect"
parameter in the synth does NOT apply to data received via midi!

Defaults...

This dialog box contains settings for five parameters, four of which have
been previously discussed in the section "Selecting, Copying, Moving, and
Auditioning Patches & Performances." The dialog text should be self-
explanatory for the first three parameters.  A highlighted box marks the
condition in effect for those options; click on another box to change the
default condition.  If you choose "Ask" for a condition, you'll get a
dialog box each time a copy/move/audition operation meeting the condition
described occurs.

The fourth parameter is MIDI THRU, and has three possible settings: "Dumb"
means that any midi input to the Atari is sent to the synth unchanged.
"Control channel" is the initial default, and is the "intelligent thru"
feature mentioned in the previous section.  This is how it works: when
auditioning PATCHES, all midi data is re-channelized to the CONTROL
CHANNEL; the number in this field should be same as the "Patch Rx"
channel set in the JV/XP (this is accessed when switching to the SYSTEM
menu from PATCH PLAY mode).  When auditioning a PERFORMANCE, the JV/XP
Manager initially re-channelizes midi data to the receive channel of
PART #1.  Other parts are selected using the PROGRAM CHANGE buttons on
your keyboard; program #2 corresponds to part 2, and so on.  All midi
events EXCEPT program changes are echoed to the synth, and program change
numbers higher than 16 are ignored.  If the performance being auditioned
has a part whose Rx (receive) parameter is turned OFF, the JV/XP Manager
will temporarily turn it ON so you can play that part, and put a message
box on the screen telling you that the performance was originally
programmed with this part's Rx parameter OFF.

The third radio button, "Off", disables midi thru.

The fifth parameter, "Device number", should be set to match the
parameter of the same name in your JV/XP.  This is set in the SYSTEM menu,
and affects system-exclusive communications between the JV/XP Manager and
the synth.  If the numbers don't match, you won't be able to request or
send any patches/perfs to or from the synth!  The number you enter here
must be between 17 and 32.

The settings you make here can be saved to a file, called JVXPMAN.DEF.
The JV/XP Manager automatically loads this file when it runs.  If this
file is NOT found, the program uses these defaults:

  When copying/moving PATCHES *within* a bank, update the performances
  that use those patches: ONLY WHEN MOVING

  When copying a PERFORMANCE from one bank to the other, also copy any
  user patch it uses: ALWAYS

  When auditioning a performance, also send the user patches contained:
  ALWAYS

  Midi thru: Control channel: 1

  Device number: 17

If these settings are good for you, there's no need to save the default
file.

Clicking "Save" sets all parameters to their current displayed values and
saves the .DEF file.  Clicking "Cancel" exits the dialog box and return to
the settings prior to calling up the Defaults dialog (unless you've saved
the .DEF file).  Clicking "Done" exits the dialog box using the current
settings.


ERRORS
======

If you're sending user patches along with performances, you may see
another message saying "One or more patches not present!".  This means
that a patch called for in the performance just sent doesn't exist; its
location is empty.  This happens if you never load or request the patches
that go with the performances, or you deleted the patch in a previous
operation.  If you overwrite the location with a different patch, the
result will be a performance playing a wrong patch! (A performance
references a patch by *number* only, and will use whatever patch it finds
at that location).
