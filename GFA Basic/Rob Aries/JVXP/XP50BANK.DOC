********    The XP50/80/JV1080 patch & performance manager     *********

This program is designed to help you manage the hundreds of patches that
can live inside your JV/XP synth.  It is NOT a patch or performance
editor, although it will do some editing operations.  This program runs in
ST High resolution (640x400x2) only.

I've tried to incorporate a number of features to do things that would
ordinarily be completely impractical if done manually.  The main thrust of
the program is to let you specify criteria for which to search and "mark"
patches or performances, then perform an action on those.  You can also
search and perform edits on those patches/performances that meet your
search criteria.  Several examples of this are:

** Go through a set of user patches/performances and mark those that use
   patches or waves from one or more expansion boards.  Nice when
   deciding which board to take out to make room for your 5th one <g>!

** Go through all user patches to find those that have the "random-pan"
   parameter set.  Replace with parameters you specify.  Or, just mark
   them for reference.

** Search, then mark all user patches that are NOT used in a user
   performance. Have you ever wanted to store an edited patch to a user
   location but weren't sure which ones weren't already being used in a
   performance?

These are only single examples; you'll be able to search by almost any
criteria, and do any kind of edit(s) you'd like.

In addition, you'll be able to:

** Consolidate patches and performances from various sources into a single
   bank of patches & performances.

** Quickly move patches and/or performances to and from various locations,
   in order to put them into a specific order.

** Quickly "assemble" a performance from scratch, then store it to any
   user location.

** Store .SYX files of only the data you want or need (for example, a
   single .SYX file could contain a "data set" for one song consisting of
   patches #24, #47-#49, performance #4, the temp performance area, etc.).

OVERVIEW

When you run the program you'll see that the screen is filled with four
boxes--two large ones on each side, and two smaller ones down the middle.
These hold the names of 2 "banks" of USER patches and performances. (In
this documentation, the word "bank" refers to a set of user patches and
corresponding user performances displayed on the screen, NOT the XP/JV
"bank" as in preset a/b/c/ exp. board, etc).  As you see, one of these
banks is already filled with initialized patches and performances; I call
this the DESTINATION bank.  The leftmost box, and the top middle box are
empty; this is the SOURCE bank.  The names "source" and "destination" are
more for convenience than anything else, as almost every operation can be
carried out on either bank; the "batch copy" function is the only one that
works from source to destination banks only, and is the reason for the
names I've given them.

I'm sorry for the small size of the text, but it was the only way I could
display all the names of two complete banks of patches and performances!
As you can see there is no room for the standard GEM menu bar, so I've had
to devise a different way for user interaction with the program.

Almost all operations take place on USER patches and performances, and
many of the functions assume that the patches and performances of either
bank are to be treated as one "set".  Since I can't envision every possible
use for this program, I let you do many things to either the patches or
performances separately; however, many of the functions look for
relationships between the two data sets; let logic be your guide here.

=======================================================================
SELECTING/MOVING/SWAPPING PATCHES & PERFORMANCES

Clicking the LEFT mouse button on a patch or performance name highlights
that patch or performance, making it SELECTED.  You can keep holding the
mouse button and slide the mouse over other patch/perf names to select
more.  Releasing the mouse, then clicking on other patches, does not clear
the previous selections; this lets you quickly make discontiguous
selections.  Click (or click & slide) the mouse over selected patches/
perfs to deselect them.   Control+alt clicking anywhere in a box
deselects ALL selected patches/perfs in that box).

Control-click on a patch/perf to copy it to another location (the patch
name moves with the mouse; release the mouse button when the name is
over the location you want to copy it to).  Alt-clicking does the same
thing except that the patches are SWAPPED.  These operations work both
within a bank or between the two banks.  Of course, patches can only be
copied/swapped to other patch locations, and performances can only be
swapped/copied to other performance locations. The UNDO key will undo the
last operation.

When a *performance* is copied/swapped from the source to destination, or
destination to source bank, an alert box will ask you if you also wish to
copy any user *patches* used by that performance.  If you answer YES, the
program will copy the patches to the first available "Init Patch" location
(if copying to the destination bank), or the first empty patch location (if
copying to the source bank).  The performance is then edited to point to
the new patch location.  Note that this applied only to performances that
contain USER patches; if the performance uses only preset or expansion
board patches, you won't see this alert box, as there won't be any need
for this.

======================================================================
MENU OPERATIONS

Click the RIGHT mouse button to pop-up a menu.  Sliding the mouse pointer
over a menu selection highlights it; clicking the left button over a
highlighted menu items selects that function; and, clicking the left
button anywhere outside the menu box clears the menu from the screen.
Nothing out of the ordinary here, except that WHERE you click the right
button has a great impact on most functions, since they can be applied to
either the source or destination bank.  Make sure the mouse pointer is
inside one of the boxes (patch or performance) of the bank you want to
work with before you bring up the menu!

LOAD .SYX FILE
SAVE .SYX FILE

These options bring up a file selector letting you load or save .SYX files
(pure system exclusive, also called "midiex" files in some places).  If
you bring up the menu by right-clicking while the mouse is in a patch box,
you'll have the o save ONLY

  An
alert box gives you the option of saving the patches or performances,
or both in one file; make sure the mouse is in the correct bank
