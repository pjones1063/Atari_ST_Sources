FONTEDIT is a program for designing and editing user font characters for
Dr. T's Copyist notation program and 9-pin epson dot-matrix printers.
(24-pin printers use the Laserjet fonts, which FONTEDIT does not
support).  The main features of FONTEDIT (and the improvements over FED)
are:

  *All font characters are displayed on one screen.
  *Characters are shown in their proper perspective.
  *Large symbols can be created by combining characters.
  *Uses the mouse! (Most functions also have keyboard equivalents).
  *More options in designing symbols.
  *Translate feature converts between epson and screen characters (and
    vice-versa).
  *Preview feature lets you work with character placement & print results.
  *Consolidate symbols from different font files.
  *Quickly copy, swap, or delete characters.
  *Backup & Undo functions.
  *Import/export font characters to art programs that use Degas (.PI3)
    files.

This program works with monochrome monitors only.

DISCLAIMERS & EXCUSES

Although every effort has been made to insure compatibility and catch bugs,
program operation is not guaranteed to be trouble free, and I cannot be
responsible for any incidental or consequential damages arising out of the
use or misuse of this program.

I can tell you right now of a known bug, but it's not in my code:  The
ST's operating system gets confused by certain operations dealing with the
mouse.  What you'll see is that whenever an alert box or file selector pops
up, the computer will thing that the left mouse button is being held down
even if it isn't.  This is a documented bug, and there is a way to deal
with it--If you're an assembly language programmer with intimate knowledge
of AES and VDI system calls.  FONTEDIT was written entirely in GFA Basic
2.0.  Like any BASIC language, the user is well-insulated from these
lower-level system calls.  What I'm trying to say is that I don't know how
to fix this yet!  You should take care when using options that deal with
file selectors or alert boxes, as you could wind up selecting an option or
loading/saving a file you didn't want.  Clicking the left mouse button once
after the alert box or file selector appears takes care of the problem.
If FONTEDIT makes it to another version, I'll try my best to figure out how
to fix this.  Meanwhile, remember how much you paid for this program!

OVERVIEW

Although the Copyist may be showing its age a bit, I still get very
favorable comments when I show someone a chart I've done.  They are even
more impressed when I tell them it was printed on my $150 9-pin dot matrix
printer.  Although I can live with the slow printing speed, I always wished
I could do something about some of the symbols (like the segno, for
instance) that didn't look as "publisher quality" as the others. I tried
using FED to make my own replacements.  Unfortunately, the user characters
seem just a little too small; I thought it might be nice to combine two or
more to form one larger symbol.  While this can be done with FED, it
requires a lot of trial and error. I decided to write FONTEDIT to let me do
this kind of thing more easily.  Of course, once I started on it, many more
ideas for additional features came to me.  I think you're going to like
them, especially if you've been struggling with FED.

Since one of the main thrusts of my program is letting you design larger
symbols, I must make the distinction between characters and symbols clear:
A 'character' is one of the ten font file characters, or one of the eight
FONTEDIT edit buffers.  A 'symbol' is a complete musical symbol, which can
be made up of from one to ten characters.

When you first boot FONTEDIT, you'll see:

-A large rectangle on the left side of the screen, divided into squares.
 This is the "work surface", an expanded view of the symbol you're
 designing or editing.  Just like FED, you fill in the squares, only now
 the mouse is used rather than the computer keyboard.

-On the bottom right are three rows of small rectangles, which hold the
 characters.  As you can probably guess, the smaller ones hold the screen
 characters and the larger ones hold the epson characters.  I divide these
 rectangles into four "areas", indicated by the labels underneath them:
 The screen fonts file buffers (bottom row), the epson fonts file buffers
 (the row above), the four epson edit buffers, and four screen edit
 buffers (in the row above the epson file buffers).  The file buffers hold
 the ten characters from your USRFONT.EPS and USRFONT.USR files; the edit
 buffers hold characters that are displayed on the work surface for you to
 alter.

-Above the three rows of characters are the on-screen buttons that work
 FONTEDIT.

BASIC PROGRAM OPERATION

FONTEDIT lets you work on either one or all four edit buffers (of either
epson or screen characters) at once.  If you choose to work on all four,
they are shown on the work surface stacked two on top of two.  This lets
you design an epson symbol up to 48 x 72 dots large, or a screen symbol up
to 16 X 24 pixels. (A single epson character is 24 by 36 dots, and a
screen character is 8 by 12 pixels.  Of course, in this "quad" mode you
can use just the top or bottom half of the work surface to design a 48 x
36 epson or 16 x 12 screen symbol, or the left or right half of the work
surface to design a 24 x 72 epson or 8 x 24 screen symbol; it's up to
you).

FONTEDIT also allows you to load in a Degas-format (.PI3) file and "grab"
up to ten epson and/or screen symbols.  Using Degas/Degas Elite (or any
other art program that uses Degas-compatible .PI3 files), you could
conceivably design one very large symbol that uses all ten characters,
arranged in any way!  This works the other way, too:  Characters can be
exported from FONTEDIT to your art program for further manipulation.  If
you don't use Degas or Degas Elite, a shareware program called PICSWITCH
will convert various format graphics files to Degas format.  This program
should be available on any BBS or service that caters to Atari ST users.

LOADING FONT FILES

By default, FONTEDIT treats the epson and screen font files as a single
entity, always loading & saving them together (unless you specify
otherwize).

Click on "Load" or press <l> to load user font files.  The familiar file
selector box appears.  FONTEDIT tries to be intelligent here:

-If you click on "OK" (or press <return>)_without specifying a file_
 (i.e., the selection box is empty), the program will search the current
 directory for USRFONTS.EPS and USRFONTS.USR, and will load them if found.

-If you _do_ specify a file, the program will determine if it's a valid
 epson or screen font file; if it is, FONTEDIT then searches the same
 directory for the corresponding file, assuming it uses the same name
 (i.e., if you select PROJECT1.EPS, the program will look for PROJECT1.USR).
 Both files will then be loaded.  This search feature only works if the
 other file uses the standard extention USR or EPS.

To load only the epson _or_ screen file, hold the shift key as you click
on "Load" or type <l>, then select the desired file.

FONTEDIT determines if a file is valid (and if it's a screen or epson
font file) only by checking its length; if it's 320 bytes it's assumed to
be the screen file, and if it's 1280 bytes it's assumed to be the epson
file.  This means you can name your user font files anything you like
(although they must eventually be named to USRFONTS.USR and USRFONTS.EPS
in order to be available to the Copyist).  Note that ANY file of 320 or
1280 bytes length is considered valid, and will load into the file buffers,
replacing whatever is there!

When the files are loaded, the characters are displayed in the lower two
rows of rectangles.

SAVING FONT FILES

Click on "Save" or press <s> to save both epson and screen fonts.  To
save _only_ epson _or_ screen fonts, hold the shift key as you click on
"Save" or press <s> and choose the file type you want to save by answering
the alert box.

Similar to loading, if you don't enter a filename, FONTEDIT will save the
file(s) with the default names USRFONTS.EPS and/or USRFONTS.USR.  **If
these files already exist, they'll be overwritten**.  If you _do_ specify
a filename, it's not necessary to type the extention as FONTEDIT forces
the proper extention (EPS or USR) to the file.

CHARACTER MANAGEMENT

Copying characters:

As previously mentioned, the basic operation of FONTEDIT requires that
characters be copied to and from the edit and file buffers.  The fastest
method is to CONTROL-click on a character.  If it's a file buffer
character, it will be copied to the first empty edit buffer; if it's an
edit buffer character, it'll be copied to the first empty file buffer.  If
there are no empty buffers available (in which case an alert box will tell
you), you'll need to use the "grab & drag" copy method, which also works
in either direction, and also _within_ each of the four areas:

 -Click on the symbol you want to copy; continue to hold the mouse
  button, and drag the image to the desired destination buffer.  Let go of
  the mouse button when the mouse pointer is within the destination
  buffer rectangle.  The source character will be copied to the
  destination buffer, _overwriting any existing character_ (if present).
  If the destination buffer is currently being displayed on the work
  surface, the work surface will re-draw.

Swapping characters:

To swap two characters, use the last method described, but hold one of
the SHIFT keys as you select the source character (it's not necessary to
keep holding the shift key as you move the character to the destination
buffer).

As you might expect, copying or swapping characters only works within the
same type (epson or screen) buffers.

Deleting characters:

Holding both the CONTROL and ALT keys as you click on any character brings
up an alert box asking if you want to erase it.  Answer "yes" and the
rectangle will empty and the symbol in it will be history.

Consolidating characters from different font files:

Although this is not a "built-in" feature, it's easy to do:  Load in the
first font file(s), and copy the character(s) you need to the edit buffers.
You can copy up to 8 screen or epson characters:  After copying the first
four, click on "Backup" (the backup buffer will be detailed shortly); you
can then copy another four characters to the edit buffers.  Load in a
different font file, and copy the characters back from the edit/backup
buffers.

CLEAR

The "Clear" button is used to quickly dump all the characters in the edit
or file buffers.  Clicking here brings up a box listing the four areas;
choose one with the mouse or click outside the box to cancel.  After
choosing an area, an alert box asks for confirmation.  This action is NOT
undoable!

THE BACKUP BUFFER

FONTEDIT has a single backup buffer that holds all eight edit buffers.
Clicking on "Backup" or pressing <b> copies the edit buffers to this
buffer. Clicking on "Get Backup" or pressing <g> copies the backup buffer
characters back to the edit buffers.  If you hold a shift key as you click
or press, the current edit buffers will _swap_ with those in the backup
buffer.

DISPLAY MODES & SELECTING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS TO EDIT

The top row of on-screen buttons determines whether you work on the epson
or screen characters, and whether you work on one or all four edit buffers
at once.  This is the "display mode".  Click on any of these four buttons
to change the mode (this doesn't do anything to the data in any of the
eight edit buffers).  Each time you change the display mode, the work
surface is re-drawn.  When the "4 eps" or "4 scr" button is highlighted,
the upper half of the work surface corresponds to buffers #1 and #2, and
the lower half corresponds to buffers #3 and #4.

The function keys F1 to F4 are the keyboard equivalents to the four
display mode buttons.

If you want to work on one particular edit buffer, all you need do is
click on it; The display mode will change to either "1 eps" or "1 scr" (if
it's not already set as such), depending on whether you clicked on an epson
or screen character.  If you click on the "1 eps" or "1 scr" button,
FONTEDIT will display the last selected epson or screen edit buffer in the
"1 eps" or "1 scr" mode.

You can also use the keyboard to go directly to a single buffer display;
press the "1" to "4" keys for epson edit buffers 1-4, and the "5" to "8"
keys for screen edit buffers 1-4.

When the display mode is set to "1 Eps" or "1 Scr", an asterix will be
displayed above the current edit buffer (the one being displayed on the
work surface).  FONTEDIT boots with the "1 Eps" work surface displayed,
ready to work on epson edit buffer #1.

DRAWING OPTIONS

The third line of on-screen buttons sets one of three draw modes:

Flip:  Clicking over an empty square fills it; clicking over a darkened
       square "empties" it.

Draw:  Fills squares.

Erase: Empties squares.

The function keys F8, F9, and F10 correspond to the three draw option
buttons.

FONTEDIT boots in "Flip" mode.  Of course, you don't need to click over
every individual square that you want to fill or empty; holding the mouse
button down as you slide the mouse over the work surface will draw, flip,
or erase squares.

Drawing aids:

Holding either SHIFT key forces straight vertical lines.  Holding the ALT
key forces straight horizontal lines.  Holding both SHIFT and ALT forces
diagonal lines.  The diagonal draw feature works like this:  When you
first click on a square with both SHIFT and ALT held, FONTEDIT makes a
note of the mouse "y" (vertical) position.  Slide the mouse left or right
to draw the line; if the mouse pointer stays _above_ the initial "y"
position, the line will slant up; if the mouse is _below_ the "y"
position, it'll slant down.  You should give the mouse a slight jog up or
down as you shift-alt-click on a square, as that will insure that the line
will slant in the direction you want.

You'll see the images in the corresponding edit buffers change as squares
are drawn or erased on the work surface.

MORE DESIGN OPTIONS

Shift:

Clicking on one of the four arrows next to "Shift" moves the image by one
square in the direction indicated by the arrow (the arrow keys do the
same thing).  Squares moved over the edge of the work surface "wrap around"
to the opposite side.

Mirror:

The "Mirror" button is similar in concept to the feature of the same name
in most drawing programs, although it's implemented differently.  Notice
that the work surface is divided into four "quadrants" which are indicated
by the slightly longer lines that bisect the rectangle at its horizontal &
vertical midpoints (of course, in "4 Eps" or "4 Scr" display mode, each
quadrant is an entire character).  The mirror function takes the image from
one quadrant and mirrors it with any other one.  This is useful in
designing symmetrical symbols such as the coda or segno.

When you click on "Mirror", a message box pops up, prompting you to click
on the desired source, then destination quadrants.  As indicated, clicking
the right mouse button at any time aborts this function.  Once you've
clicked on two quadrants, the mirroring takes place; the edit buffer is
altered and the work surface is re-drawn. (The Undo function will restore
the buffer previous to the mirroring).

Fill:

This works just like most art programs.  When the "Fill" button is
highlighted (by clicking on it or typing <f>), the normal flip, draw, and
erase functions are disabled.  Clicking on a square now fills in every
adjacent square up to an already filled-in square.  Like any program that
implements this feature, if the area you are filling is not completely
bounded by filled-in squares, your fill may "leak" out.  If this happens,
press the Undo key (or the right mouse button) to restore the buffer.

The fill feature operates on only one character buffer at a time, even in
the "4 eps" or "4 scr" display mode.  This means that if you are in one of
those modes, and the shape you are filling in extends from one buffer to
another, you'll have to separately click in the portion of each quadrant
that needs to be filled.

Fill mode is exited either by clicking on "Fill" (or pressing <f>) a
second time, or choosing a draw option.

THE UNDO FUNCTION

The "Undo" key undoes the last flip, draw, erase, fill, copy, or mirror
operation.  Pressing Undo again "undoes the undo", allowing comparisons.
Undo _doesn't work with the translate feature_ (described next).

There is a "mouse equivalent" to the Undo key:  Pressing the right mouse
button.  This comes in handy if you've been altering squares on the work
surface and you don't feel like taking your hand off the mouse to press the
Undo key (aren't we lazy?!).

TRANSLATING SYMBOLS BETWEEN EPSON AND SCREEN FORMATS

As you know, when you design an epson character you should also design a
corresponding screen character so you can tell what you're doing while in
the Copyist.  FONTEDIT has two functions to help this process: "Translate",
which analyzes a screen or epson edit buffer and draws its counterpart as
best it can, and "Overlay", which draws a "shadow" of the corresponding
buffer over the current work buffer, letting you see exactly how the
characters line up.  These functions are independent of each other,
although they were designed to be used together.

There are no on-screen buttons or keyboard equivalents to invoke these
features; you only need to "grab & drag" an epson edit buffer character to
a screen edit buffer, or vice-versa.  Doing this will bring up one of two
alert boxes.  If:

  -You are in either "1 eps or "1 scr" display mode...

  -The destination buffer is the one _currently displayed_ on the
    work surface (i.e., you are dragging the source buffer image to the
    buffer you're working on)...

...you'll get an alert box letting you choose either of the two
functions, or cancel.  If either of these conditions are _not_ met, the
Translate function will be the only one available to you.  In this case, a
different alert box will appear, asking for confirmation (the Translate
function overwrites the destination buffer, with no undoing possible, so
you should either back up the buffers or copy the destination buffer to
another one before translating).

If you choose the Overlay function, there will be a slight delay as
FONTEDIT prepares the image of the source buffer; then you'll see it appear
on the work surface "shadowed" over the current buffer.  The space bar
toggles the overlay image on and off.  Also, any draw, flip, or erase
action temporarily removes the image from the work surface while the mouse
button is held down (this is to avoid conflicts in how the images are
combined).

Switching to a different buffer or changing draw modes cancels the
overlay function and erases the overlay image, if present.

Although both the Overlay and Translate features work in either direction
(screen to epson or epson to screen format), the best results occur when
overlaying an epson buffer on to a screen buffer, after having translated
it beforehand.  In most instances this will be the usual situation,
although it would be entirely feasible to design a symbol by overlaying
onto an empty buffer.

USING AN ART PROGRAM TO DESIGN/EDIT SYMBOLS

Although FONTEDIT goes beyond FED in its symbol-design features, there
are many things that a good art program such as Degas or Degas Elite can do
to help.  With the "Load .PI3" and "Save .PI3" buttons, you can now import
and export font characters to and from these programs (or any others that
support the Degas .PI3 high-rez, _uncompressed_ file format).

When you use an art program to design or edit font characters, you must
draw them on the upper 3/4 of the screen; this is because FONTEDIT doesn't
use the entire image--It needs some room on the bottom to display the
screen and epson file buffers and buttons for grabbing characters and
exiting back to the main page.

Exporting font characters:

Click on "Save .PI3".  An alert box pops up, asking you to "Choose output
image".  You have two choices (along with a "Cancel" button):

 "Buffers":  Here, your .PI3 file will contain the images of all the edit
             and file buffers.  Before you get the file selector allowing
             you to save the file, another alert box asks if you want
             boxes drawn around the characters.  The default is NO boxes;
             this makes it easier to copy or move the characters in your
             art program.  Also, a line is drawn delineating the
             previously mentioned "safe" area of the image, so you'll
             know where NOT to draw when you import the edited file back
             into FONTEDIT.

 "Preview":  In this case, the .PI3 file will contain whatever is
             displayed on the "Preview/Print" page.  This page is
             discussed later in this doc file; essentially, this
             lets you save a specific _arrangement_ of characters,
             perhaps a "compound" symbol created by combining multiple
             characters together.  Note that the "safe line" mentioned
             earlier is NOT included in this .PI3 file.

Importing .PI3 files:

Characters that are "grabbed" from .PI3 files are placed in the ten epson
or screen _file_ (not edit) buffers.

Click on "Load .PI3", then choose the file to load when the selector
appears.  FONTEDIT first checks to make sure it's the correct
(uncompressed Degas .PI3) format.  If so, the image will be loaded,
replacing the current screen.  The bottom 1/4 of the screen will display
the current epson and screen file buffers, and several buttons:

 EXIT--Takes you back to the main page.  Now, SHIFT-clicking on "Load .PI3"
       will return you to the previously loaded screen.

 GRAB--The "Epson" and "Screen" buttons next to this label are radio
       buttons that tell FONTEDIT whether you want to grab epson or
       screen characters from your .PI3 file.

When the mouse is in the picture area, a rectangle representing a screen
or epson character appears (depending on which option is highlighted next
to the "Grab" label), and moves with the mouse pointer.  I call this the
"grab box".  There are two methods of grabbing pieces of the image and
copying them to the file buffers:

--"Grab & drag": Place the grab box around the area you want to grab,
  press and hold the button, and drag the image to one of the ten file
  buffer locations.  Let go of the mouse button when the pointer is within
  the buffer rectangle. **Any character already in that buffer will be
  overwritten by this operation, with no warning alert, and no undoing
  possible**.  A copy of the grab box is left on the image, and may be
  used as an alignment aid for the next grab. (You could also now switch
  to the "click & copy" method, described next).

--"Click & copy": This method works anytime there is a copy of the grab
  box left on the image. (If you've just entered this page, this copy
  won't be there--You could either "grab & drag" the first character, or
  just place the grab box around the area you want to grab, and click the
  mouse button).  Once this box is there, move the mouse to a point _below_
  the "safe line" (so that the grab box is no longer attached to the
  mouse).  When the mouse is below this line, the ST's arrow keys move the
  copied grab box around the image.  At any point, clicking directly on the
  "GRAB" label copies the image in this grab box to the first
  available empty file buffer.  Unshifted, each press of the arrow keys
  moves the box by one buffer space horizontally or vertically.  With a
  shift key held, the box moves by one Copyist space. This makes it very
  easy to grab a musical symbol that uses a number of characters spaced
  horizontally, stacked vertically, or both.

You can't swap or copy characters within the file buffers on this page.

PREVIEW/PRINT

This feature lets you experiment with placing symbols and printing them
out.  Clicking on this button or pressing <p> brings you to a new screen,
which is essentially a Copyist "mini-page".  At the upper left corner is
the rectangular cursor.  At the bottom of the screen is the "buffer display
panel", showing the current epson edit and file buffer characters along
with six option buttons.  All the buttons except "Print" have keyboard
equivalents.

As you can see from the size of the cursor, we aren't dealing with the
screen characters at all; the point is to see the final printed results.
Screen characters will appear exactly as FONTEDIT displays them, anyway.

I've purposefully duplicated some of the key commands & sequences used by
the Copyist on this page.  Here are descriptions of all the keyboard and
mouse options:

Arrow keys:  The ST's arrow keys move the cursor around the screen.
Unshifted, the cursor moves by one "Copyist space".  Pressed with a shift
key held, the cursor moves by one rectangle length (or width), which is
helpful when placing a symbol created in "4 eps" mode.

The cursor can also be moved with the mouse.  Unlike the Copyist, it'll
follow the mouse around the screen if you keep the button held down.

<Clr/Home>:  Moves the cursor to the top left of the screen.

<Control> + <Clr/Home>:  Moves the cursor to the bottom right of the
screen.

Space bar or right mouse button:  Toggles the buffer display panel on and
off the page.  There may be instances where you'll want to use the entire
page (for instance, if you are designing a symbol that uses ten characters
arranged vertically).  If the cursor is at the bottom of the page when you
restore the panel, it'll be "bumped up".  Any character(s) placed at that
location will remain there, however (even though hidden behind the panel)
and will print out.

Incidentally, this page as displayed _without_ the buffer display panel
is what's saved when selecting "Save .PI3", then choosing "Preview".

Of course, all keyboard commands remain active when the panel is off the
screen. (The "Print" button has no keyboard equivalent, so the panel must
be on-screen if you want to print the page).

<1> ~ <4>:  These buttons (either on the QWERTY keyboard or numeric
keypad) place the corresponding _edit buffer_ character at the current
cursor location.

<Alt> + <1> ~ <0> (QWERTY keyboard only):  Like the Copyist, this will
place the corresponding _file buffer_ character at the current cursor
location.

Characters can also be placed using the mouse if the display panel is
present:  Click on the desired character to place it at the current cursor
location.

** Note:  FONTEDIT limits you to 50 characters on this page.  This isn't
quite as much as the Copyist's maximum of 9000, but should be enough for
most needs!

<Delete>:  Also like the Copyist, pressing the delete key followed by a
character key (<1> ~ <4> or <Alt> + <1> ~ <0>) will erase the character
at the current cursor location.

<Delete>, followed by <a>:  Deletes any character at the cursor location
(sounds familiar, right?!).

Characters can be deleted using the mouse if the display panel is up.
Click on the "Delete" button to highlight it, then click on the edit or
file buffer character you want to delete (you can't delete <a>ny character
with the mouse).  As before, the cursor must be on the character you are
deleting.

Note that the "Delete" button on the panel highlights both when you click
on it or press the <Delete> key.  If you change your mind, press the
<Return> key, or press the <Delete> key or click on "Delete" a second time.
You could also just move the cursor off the character, then select any
edit or file buffer character, or simply select a character _other_ than
the one at the cursor location. Toggling the display panel also clears the
delete function.

The "Exit" button (keyboard equivalents <Esc> or <Undo>):  Returns you to
FONTEDIT'S main page.  Your work is retained and will be displayed if you
return to the PREVIEW/PRINT page, although it may not look the same if
you've changed any font characters in the interim, as only the character
number and location is retained, not the actual images.

The "Save" button (keyboard equivalent <s>):  Saves the current
"mini-page".  A file selector will appear; the file saved will have the
extention .MEJ, for ".ME junior"!  This could come in handy if, for
instance, you're experimenting with symbols whose design depend on a
specific arrangement of characters; you may want to save this arrangement
so you can return to it a later time.

The "Load" button (keyboard equivalent <l>):  This option lets you load
previously saved .MEJ files into the current page.  If there are
characters already present, an alert box will ask you if you want to
_add_ the characters in the .MEJ file to those on the page, or simply
replace the current page with the characters from the file (Replace is the
default).  If you choose "Add", FONTEDIT checks to see that the total
number of characters doesn't exceed 50.  If the total does exceed this
number, another alert box will ask you if you want to add as many as
possible up to the maximum of 50, or abort the load operation completely.

Note that .MEJ files are in no way compatible with standard Copyist .ME
files!  Also, only the character number and placement is saved in the
file, NOT the actual font characters themselves.  Loading an .MEJ file
with different font characters than when the file was originally saved
will guarantee that your page will _not_ look the same!

The "Clear" button (keyboard equivalent <c>):  Erases the entire page
(after a confirming alert box).  There is NO undo for this.

The "Print" button:  Prints the page.  There must be at least one symbol
on the page in order for this function to be active.  If your printer
isn't on-line, FONTEDIT gives you an alert box allowing you to retry or
cancel.  You'll find that keeping your symbols on the left side of the 
page will make for faster printing.

TIPS

FONTEDIT can be run from within the Copyist by renaming it to one of the
printer driver programs (HPLME.PRG, HPPME.PRG or HPDME.PRG) and selecting
the corresponding menu selection from the "Print" menu (HP laser, plotter,
or Deskjet, respectively).  Unlike FED, the Copyist will not recognize any
changes made to the screen fonts without re-booting.  This can be fixed
by simply running, then quitting FED (the usual way, by selecting "Font
Editor" under the "Print" menu).  When FED is run from the Copyist, it
reads the current USRFONT.USR file and changes the screen fonts to whatever
is in that file.  So, all you need to do is make sure you save your files
with the default names (by leaving the selection box in the file selector
blank, as detailed previously) before quitting FONTEDIT. (Don't forget
that this will overwrite any existing USRFONT.USR and USRFONT.EPS files
with no warning alert box or undoing possible).

** Note: Don't do any renaming of files on your Copyist master disk!!

Another problem comes to mind when using FONTEDIT to design larger
"compound" symbols that use more than one character.  Since the Copyist
allows only ten user characters, you may find yourself wanting more.
As I'm not about to disassemble & patch the Copyist, and further updates
for the ST version are most likely a pipe dream, the only way to do this
is the "brute force" (or, some would say, "unbelieveably kludgey")
approach:  Print the file with the first set of user symbols, then erase
all the user symbols, load in new ones, then place them in the file.  Now,
erase everything _but_ the new symbols, put the paper back in the printer
and print again.  This isn't very pretty, I'll have to admit.  However,
I'm working on some software that will help with these tasks---stay
tuned.
