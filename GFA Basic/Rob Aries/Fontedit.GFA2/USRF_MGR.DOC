USRFONMG.PRG is a small utility that helps manage user font files for the
Atari Copyist.  It supports the screen and Epson 9-pin user fonts files,
NOT the Laserjet fonts (.HPL), which are used by both laser printers and
24-pin dot-matrix printers.

Since I wrote and started using FONTEDIT, I found myself accumulating
many sets of user fonts files (usually one or two for every song!).  Of
course, the Copyist can only use one set at a time, and they must be named
USRFONTS.USR and USRFONTS.EPS in order to be visible to  Copyist and its
Epson printer driver program. This program lets you easily change the
active set of files, by copying and re-naming any set you choose to the
default names and placing them in the Copyist's work directory (if they're
not there already).

To use this program, copy it to the Copyist's *program* directory (where
the Copyist looks for the various printer driver programs & font files),
and rename it to one of the unused printer driver programs (either
HPLME.PRG or HPPME.PRG).  This lets you run it from within the Copyist (by
selecting either "Laserjet" or "Plotter" from  "Print" menu).

 IMPORTANT:  Do NOT do this with your Copyist master disk!!  If you have a
             floppy-based system and boot from the master disk, it's
             assumed that you've copied all the auxilliary programs & font
             files to a DIFFERENT disk.

There are a few rules to follow in order for USRFONMG.PRG to work
correctly:

 1.  As mentioned previously, the program must reside in the Copyist's
     program directory.

 2.  Your user fonts files must have the correct extentions (.USR and
     .EPS), and each set of *corresponding* .USR and .EPS files must have
     the same name (for example, if a screen user fonts file is named
     MYSONG.USR, the corresponding Epson file must be named MYSONG.EPS).

When the program runs, a file selector appears.  Select the user fonts
file you want--either the .EPS or .USR file--and the program will do its
thing and quit (both files will be copied and renamed).

Of course, when the files are copied and re-named, any previously existing
USRFONTS.USR and USRFONTS.EPS files residing in the program directory
will be history!  Accordingly, ALL your user fonts files should be named
differently; the filenames "USRFONTS.USR" and "USRFONTS.EPS" should be
considered "reserved" for temporary use while editing or printing a file.

If you use USRFONMG.PRG from withing the Copyist, you'll notice that the
previous screen fonts will still be active when you go back to editing
your .ME file.  To make the new ones active, simply select "Font Editor"
from the "Print" menu.  This will run FED.PRG, the Copyist's user font
editing program.  When this program runs, it looks for the USRFONTS.USR
file and loads it into the Copyist.  All you need do is immediately quit
(by pressing the <Esc> key and answering "y" to the "Leave font editor?"
prompt).  The new user screen fonts will now be active.
