MEA CULPA!

I see why some may have had some problems with SWITCHER. I am 
using my SWITCHER from my hard drive, and apparently it searches 
the root directory.
 
If you are using a floppy disk, apparently the code won't search 
the root directory. In fact, what it is doing is looking in the 
auto folder for the DESKTOP.INF and DESKTOP.MED or .LOW files. I 
am uploading a revision to GEnie. I will call it SWITCH2.ARC. The 
revision will now search the root directory properly on either a 
hard disk or a floppy.

Also, be sure that you have _ONLY_ one or the other; a .MED or a 
.LOW file on the root directory with the DESKTOP.INF. In other 
words, there should be only 2 DESKTOP.??? files at a time in the 
root; a DESKTOP.INF and a DESKTOP.LOW  =OR=  a DESKTOP.INF and a 
DESKTOP.MED!

The easiest way to achieve the above is to boot your computer, set 
up the desktop the way you like it in LOW REZ, then save the 
desktop using the menu selection SAVE DESKTOP. Then use SHOW INFO 
to change the name from "DESKTOP.INF" to "DESKTOP.LOW". Next, use 
SET PREFERENCES to change to MED REZ, rearrange things like you 
want them and use SAVE DESKTOP again.

I am including the source  listing in this upload for those that 
have a compiler and want to fool around with the program.

My apologies for making it seem like a puzzler.
