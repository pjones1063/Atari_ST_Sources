PCI Test v1.00
by Lonny Pursell and ENCOM
Released Jul 1, 2003


Can GFA-Basic access the PCI Bios?  It sure can!

This is a partial port of the file SAMPLE.C from the PCI Bios
developers kit.  It should be enough to get someone started.
I strongly recommend downloading the actual PCI Bios developers
kit as I did not comment this listing.  It follows the orginal
'C' listing fairly closely and it should be easy to add the
the other functions as needed.

As with all my stuff, use it at your own risk!  ;o)

Included is a compiler version and the source code.
Enjoy!
