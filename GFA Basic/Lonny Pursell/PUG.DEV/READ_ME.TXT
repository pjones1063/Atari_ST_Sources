This archive contains GFA-Basic code to access an OVL.

The OVL used is called PUG.  PUG was not created by me,
and I claim no rights to it whatsoever.

PUG is an OVL for handling window management.  See the
docs on PUG for more information and who created it.

The code here is very old, but I've decided to release it
so others can see how an OVL can be used from GFA-Basic.

Use entirely at your own risk.  :)
