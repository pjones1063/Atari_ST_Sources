
MONOPOLY.DOC - Documentation for MONOPOLY.ARC & usage of MONOPOLY.PRG

MONOPOLY.PRG is a compiled GFA BASIC program that can be directly executed
from the desktop.  It requires the system to be in low resolution mode.
All of the other files in MONOPOLY.ARC except MONOPOLY.BAS are data files
required by the program.  These files may be put into a folder named
MONOFILE for ease of use.

MONOPOLY.BAS is the GFA BASIC source code that was compiled into MONOPOLY.PRG
It was written by David Addison in True BASIC on an Amiga, and converted by
him into GFA BASIC for the Atari ST.

The program and GFA BASIC source are in the Public Domain, and are not to be
sold, especially because Monopoly is of course a Trademark of Parker Brothers.

Enjoy.
