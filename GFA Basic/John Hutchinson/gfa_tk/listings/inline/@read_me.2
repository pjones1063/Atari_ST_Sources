                           INLINE DATA FILES

     ===============================================================

     The *.INL files in this folder contain the INLINE data which is 
     used by some of the TOOLKIT routines.  Those routines which 
     contain an INLINE statement have been saved in both source (*.GFA) 
     and ASCII (*.LST) format.

     The *.GFA files include the INLINE data but the *.LST files do 
     not.  This is because whenever you "Save,A" a GFA BASIC file, it 
     is saved simply as an ASCII text file, thus deleting all the data 
     which was originally stored in the INLINE variables.  Thusly, you 
     should _never_ Save,A a GFA BASIC program which contains INLINE 
     data unless you have the INLINE files available for reloading 
     into the INLINE statements.

     Should you need to do so, follow these steps to reload data into 
     an INLINE variable:

          1.  Within the GFA BASIC editor (version 3.07 and above), 
          place the cursor on the line which has the INLINE statement 
          you wish to reload.

          2.  Press the "Help" key on your keyboard.

          3.  Note the menu which appears above the function key menu 
          in the editor.  Select "Load" from this menu or simply press 
          the "L" key on your keyboard.

          4.  From the fileselect box which appears, select the *.INL 
          file whose filename and filesize corresponds to that of the 
          INLINE variable you wish to load.  For example, for the line

               INLINE bascode%,2794

          you should choose the file BASCODE.INL which is 2794 bytes in 
          length.  Select the appropriate *.INL file and select "OK" 
          from the fileselect box or simply press RETURN.  Ignore any 
          "End of File" error messages which may appear.

          5.  The data in the *.INL file will then be loaded into the 
          memory space reserved by the INLINE variable name.

          6.  SAVE your GFA BASIC program (_not_ Save,A).  Note that 
          the program length has increased by the size of the *.INL 
          file you loaded indicating the data has been properly stored 
          with your *.GFA file.
