                               ROUTINES

     ===============================================================

     1. Some routines contain INLINE statements and have therefore 
     been saved in both source (*.GFA) and ASCII (*.LST) format 
     (with the single exception of the DEGASINL routine).  If you
     need to reload data into an INLINE variable, follow the 
     instructions in the READ_ME file located in the INLINE\ folder.

     2. The default variable type for all routines is the BYTE type.  
     You should insure your program specifies BYTE as the default by 
     using a line such as the following in the initialization portion 
     of your program:

                             DEFBYT "a-z"

     If you desired, you may, of course, choose the default variable 
     type of INTEGER.  Just ensure that all routines, TOOLKIT's and 
     otherwise, expect the correct variable types.

     3. All the TOOLKIT routines have been thoroughly tested on various 
     Atari ST systems ranging from a 512K 520ST with TOS 1.0 to a 4 
     Megabyte MegaSTe with TOS 2.05.  This does _not_, however, 
     represent the full range of Atari computers and operating systems 
     available to date and users are thus cautioned they are 
     responsible for assuring compatibility with _their_ system.   
     Furthermore, while most routines should be compatible with the 
     Atari TT, not all have been tested on that system.  The routines 
     have _not_ designed to take advantage of special TT-only features 
     such as TT screen resolutions.  Some routines may not be compatible
     with alternative desktop programs such as Neodesk.

     4. At this writing, GFA Software Technologies is about to release 
     version 3.7 of GFA BASIC which is said to correct certain problems
     found in version 3.6, the interim version released to support TT
     features.  It is expected that 3.7 will also correct some of the
     memory management problems noted in the GFA BASIC 3.5 compiler
     which should improve if not eliminate problems noted running
     compiled GFA 3.5 programs on the new Atari TOS 3.6.  Version 3.7 
     should then be the recommended GFA BASIC version for users of
     Atari ST, STe, and TT computers.

     5.  Remember... you are free to use and modify these routines in 
     your own programs.  Good luck and have fun with GFA BASIC.
