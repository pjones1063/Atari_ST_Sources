
                      GFA BASIC TOOLKIT, VOLUME 1

                             DEMO PROGRAMS

     ===============================================================

     Two example programs have been included on the Toolkit diskette 
     to demonstrate the use of most of the Toolkit routines:

          DEMO.GFA       For computers with 1Mb or more RAM

          MINIDEMO.GFA   For computers with 512K RAM

     Both programs run in either medium resolution color or high 
     resolution monochrome ST modes.  Due to memory and disk space 
     limitations, most but not all Toolkit routines are included in 
     the demo programs.  Their use, however, is well documented  
     through similar routines and in the Toolkit book itself.

     Users of comupters with only 512K RAM should ensure the maximum 
     amount of memory is available by temporarily disabling all
     desk accessory and AUTO folder programs.  Some routines may not
     be compatible with alternative desktop programs such as Neodesk.

     Included for use with these programs are several sample graphics
     picture files stored in the PICS folder.

     Load the appropriate demo GFA source code file into your GFA 
     BASIC interpreter (3.07 or higher).  Run the program then examine 
     the source code at your leisure.  Remember, however, that these 
     demo programs have been written with clarity foremost in mind, 
     not utmost speed or efficiency.  You CAN improve upon them!

     The DEMO.GFA program contains some routines with an INLINE 
     statement.  Do NOT Save,A any program with INLINE statements or 
     you will erase all data stored in the INLINE variables.  If you 
     should need to reload data into an INLINE variable, follow the 
     instructions in the READ_ME file located in the INLINE\ folder.

     Remember... you are free to use and modify these routines for use 
     in your own programs.  Good luck and fun with GFA BASIC.
