     This is the 9th in a planned series of GFA Tip files.  The 
topic of this issue is creating a TTP file from GFA Basic.  In 
this archive you will find the following files:


              MORE.TTP =>Compiled GFA Basic TTP File
          MORE.BAS => GFA Basic Source Code for Program
                    GFATIP09.DOC => This file

     Since the source code file is pretty self explanatory, I will 
keep this Doc file pretty short.  A bit of explanation comes 
first.  A TTP file must be:
                           Mandatory
     1. Compiled
                           Optional   
     
     2. Clicked directly from the Desktop
     3. Used with a CLI
     4. Called from a Parent Program using EXEC

     The only effective way to test a TTP program is to compile it 
and test it directly.  You will note that you can not run the 
source for the More program from the interpreter without 
modification.  "So keep it in mind that you can not prepare TTP 
programs without the GFA Basic Compiler."

     Since there has been a lot of discussion in the MichTron 
Bulletin Board about doing this sort of thing, I felt it was time 
to demonstrate it.  The little utility that I've cooked up for you 
is nice to have around with a CLI that does not have the MORE 
command.  Use it with this .DOC file to see just what it will do.

Try this Command:

     Double click on MORE.TTP

     Enter this on the command line:

     GFATIP09.DOC

     What will happen is the file will be displayed to the screen 
line for line until end of file.  At the bottom of each page the 
screen will pause until you press a key.  At the end of the file 
you see "EOF Please press a key to end".  You will then be 
returned to the desktop.  You can try the same thing with a CLI 
such as DOS Shell by Tim Purves like this:

     From the prompt:

     A>run more gfatip09.doc
     -or-
     A>more.ttp gfatip09.doc

     (How your particular CLI functions may vary)
 
     When you press return, the file will be displayed on the 
screen for you in much the same manner except that you are 
returned to the CLI instead of the desktop. 

Word of Warning!!!!!!

     By examining the source code you will find that I have NOT 
included ANY error trapping.  YOU MUST enter the correct file name 
to be read by the More program along with it's extension.  It will 
ONLY work properly with ASCII files (ie...non ascii files can be 
displayed, however the results are unpredictable and may hang up 
the computer).  So the bottom line is that you will have to do the 
work to create a smooth running un-crashable program, this one is 
just an example.

     I hope this file and code helps to answer all of the 
questions that you all have had concerning this subject.  If you 
happen to get stuck with something drop either myself or Rich Noe 
(NOEGFA) a letter via GEnie Email and we'll try to help out.
