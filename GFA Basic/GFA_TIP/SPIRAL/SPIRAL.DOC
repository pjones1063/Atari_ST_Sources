                             SPIRAL  GRAPH


       Create fantastic designs with Steven Hunt's pattern generator


Computer Spiral Graph, as it's name suggests, generates those fascinating
patterns that are drawn using biros and toothed wheels in that childrens toy.
No such things are needed on the ST, just good old GFA BASIC and a few simple
routines.

    To see an example of the sort of beautiful screens that Spiral Graph can
create first boot up GFA BASIC (v2) and then load the BASIC listing from the
SIDE_2 folder of the cover disk. (De-archive it first!) Run the program in
medium resolution and select option 10 to load a previously drawn image (the
picture isn't loaded, just the data specifying the angles, lines,
magnifications and so on). The file name can be SPIRA1, SPIRA2, SPIRA4... There
are several examples on the disk. After loading the data, select option three
to draw the whole picture. Now sit back and watch the image being built up.

Here's a breakdown of the 11 options on the menu:

Option 1: (Edit wheel specifications)
This is used to set up each wheel (or toothed cog's) parameters.

Option 2: (Draw a wheel)
Draw using just one wheel.

Option 3: Draw a complete picture)
Draw the picture using all the wheels at the same time. Press 1, 2 or 3 to
change the medium res drawing colours.

Option 4: (See all wheel specifications)
Use this to examine the wheel data.

Option 5: (Change view distance)
Enlarges or reduces the picture.

Option 6: (Change X,Y start position)
Alter this to centre the picture.

Option 7: (Change number of wheels)
Alter the number of wheels used in the full drawing.

Option 8: (Change colours)
Use this to change the palette.

Option 9: (Save wheel specifications)
Saves all the data parameters used to draw the picture.

Option 10: (Load wheel specifications)
Load the wheel data for a picture.

Option 11: (Change screen save name)
This is the filename used to save the screen when S is press during drawing.
