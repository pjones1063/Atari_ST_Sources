     Welcome,noble   adventurer,to   the 
first  in the Dungeon Adventure  series, 
aptly titled Part One.

     The   Dungeon   Adventure    series 
transports  you to a  far off world,many  
miles away from Earth.

     The  World  has no  name,as  nobody 
thought to give it one.They simply refer 
to   it  as  The  World.The   World   is 
small,similar to Earth in many respects.

     Look  closely,and  you can  see  an 
island.The  inhabitants call it  Rakkal. 
It  is  very  small,only  a  few   miles 
across.The  only point of notice is  the 
mountain.

     The Mountain,as the locals call it, 
is   extremely  big,and  has  been   for 
several millenia.It will continue to  be 
so   until,according  to  local   super-
stition,until The Day of Morron.

     Morron  was,and  maybe  still  is,a 
great  sorcerer.He lived on  Rakkal  for 
all   his  life,helping  in   day-to-day 
running of a village called Sakara.

     Then one day,Morron was visited  by 
an  old  mage from  the  mainland.Nobody 
knows  the  exact story,but  within  two 
days Morron had vanished.

     The  old folk tell of Morron  being 
tainted   by  Chaos,and   becoming   the 
servant   of  the mage.Stories  tell  of 
Morron building a tortuous dungeon under 
the island,and through The Mountain.

     People  say that when The World  is 
destined   to  end,The   Mountain   will 
split  open,and Morron  will  emerge,far 
more powerful than before.He will  wreak 
havoc  on  the island,and all  over  The 
World,sorcerers  tainted by  Chaos  will 
rise up and destroy the village.

     But   Morron  vanished   over   two 
hundred  years  ago,and he  hasn't  been 
seen since.

     There  is a pub.This is  where  you 
come in.

     You  are celebrating your  birthday 
by  getting  completely  drunk.You   are 
doing well.

       Notes from the Programmer:

     Thanks  very  much for  buying  (or 
copying)  this  game.It  is   completely 
Public  Domain,and  you are  welcome  to 
copy it for your friends.If you do  this 
however,you  must  leave all  the  files  
intact.
     I'll be keeping close tabs on where 
the program gets to,Public  Domain-Wise, 
and  I'll  be  checking  up  to  see  if 
anyone's fiddled it and sent it in!
     I don't mind if you send this  into 
any Libraries,by all means do,it'll make 
me famous (ahem).
     This  is  my  first  Public  Domain 
release,under the Chaos Software  label. 
In fact,it's my first ever serious "bash" 
at programming.If you're feeling  gener-
ous,send  me a couple of quid  (please!) 
and   I'll,er,spend  it.By  the   way,if 
you're  really having problems with  the 
adventure,just  drop me a line,and  I'll 
be    only    to    happy    to    help. 
Part  Two  of  this  adventure  will  be 
available   directly  from  me  at   the 
address  coming up,or maybe from  Public 
Domain,if I'm feeling generous.
     The  game was written in GFA  Basic 
(Version 3),over a period of about three
months.The   program   underwent    many 
changes,including  the  erasure  of  ten 
locations (I had a ruddy power cut!)
     If   you  discover  any   bugs,send 
details  (and version number) to  me  at 
the address below.
     By  the way - there's a  prize  for 
the first person to finish!  Details  at 
the end of the game.(Ha ha!)
     I'll  just  give  the  other  Chaos 
Titles a quick plug while I'm  here.Look 
out  for  the following titles  at  your 
"local" PD Library.If they aren't there, 
drop me a line explaining the  situation 
and  I'll let you know if I've  actually 
written it yet.
     Anyway.Look    out   for    Dungeon 
Adventure  Part One (mind you  -  you've 
already got it,so don't  bother),Dungeon 
Adventure Part Two  (inevitably),Rogue's 
Quest  (a slightly more  serious  STAC'd 
adventure involving such fun elements as 
house-breaking  and murder),I.D.L.S. (an
inter-galactic  hacking   simulation,but 
I'll probably  never  get  it finished).
Er...there'll probably (sorry - prob'ly)
be  a few STAC adventures "in the  pipe-
line",so keep your eyes peeled.Cheerio.
