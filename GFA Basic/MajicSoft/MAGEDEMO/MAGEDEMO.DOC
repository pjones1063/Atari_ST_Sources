                Welcome to the M.A.G.E. Demo Disk!

First off M.A.G.E. stands for Majic Arcade Graphics Engine, which 
simply means using this tool you can design some of the best 
arcade action games in GFA BASIC ever written for play on the 
Atari ST/Ste/TT/Falcon computers. 

If our company is new to you, or if you don't know what 
exactly M.A.G.E. can do then maybe this will help. The following
games were designed using the 100% exact same tools available 
from within the M.A.G.E. system. (Further reference will be 
as simply MAGE.) These games are available from your local public 
domain supplier.

 1) GP_Shoot    - A simple shooter.
 2) KID_GP      - A cute platform game.
 3) Evader      - Fast action shooter.
 4) MS.Munchie  - A great arcade conversion!
 5) Kaboom!     - Fast addictive fun.
 6) Frogger     - Classic hopping fun.
 7) Cud Lee     - Platform adventure.
 8) Instectroid - Similar to Galaga.
 9) Kid_Kong    - The definitive Donkey Kong for the ST!
10) ST Invaders - Line em up and shoot em!
11) Bugs!       - Classic garden insect invasion.
12) Megapede    - Combines the classic Centipede/Millipede.
13) Dlx Invader - (Deluxe Invaders) True to the 8 bit cart.
14) Sleuth      - Remeber Shamus on the 8 bit?
15) Thurg-Murg  - Cute platform game for two players.
16) Dark Pearl  - Bounce the pearl over the scrolling maze.

Chances are if you have an ST and play games, you have probably 
already played 1 or more of these popular games. You probably also 
didn't know that the majority of the above games took less than 3 
weeks to program. All of the above games were written to show what 
the MAGE system can do without spending most of your youth on the 
design process. Bottom line, MAGE allows you to design fun style 
games quickly. It makes us extremely excited to think what someone 
could do with these tools if they spent say, 2-3 months on a 
project! Ok, let's dive into exactly what the MAGE system is.

The editors:

MAGE comes with 4 editing tools to help you design the background 
graphics and animation for your games. These consist of:

The Character Editor

This is where you design those fancy letters or little graphics 
called "Characters". Design a character that looks like a tree, 
then plot that tree on the screen several times and now you've got 
a whole forest to walk through! Get the idea? The character editor 
is also where you would design your sprite for your games. Sprite? 
What's a sprite? A sprite is simply anything that moves on your 
screen. But in the MAGE system it's usually a little object that 
you first designed in the character editor, brought it to life 
with the animation editor and then finally un-leashed in your 
program. Sprites can interact with the background characters. So 
you can for instance, detect if a sprite is moving over one of 
those trees, therefore you might not let him travel anywhere else 
until he(she!) gets out of those trees! Again, the MAGE system 
makes all of this a breeze to program.

The Animation Editor

Now that you have designed a bunch of sprite images using the 
characted editor, you now have to tell the MAGE kernal how to 
animate them. This is where the anim editor comes into play. You 
can draw a path for the sprite to follow using the mouse, you can 
set up some frame animations to make the sprites look like they 
are walking, throwing, etc. What ever YOU want them to do. The 
animation editor is not a cad program, it's designed to allow the 
novice programmer to get some results effortlessly and quickly.

The Map editor

This is where you can design the backgrounds for your games. Using 
the character editor you have defined a bunch of little cells that 
may form larger images, or they may be defined as singular images. 
It don't matter, again it's up to YOU the DESIGNER of YOUR game 
to think of these things. So you load these character cells into 
the map editor and start creating your game world. What's your 
preference, Fantasy?, Arcade?, Military?, use your mouse and 
let your imagination fly. 

Inline Maker

This simply helps you compact your data so that it can all reside 
inside of your program code. A real file saver. How about all 
those other pd games you've played that has about 2 dozen files!!

The MAGE Design Shell

This is where you get your GFA BASIC up and running. Here, using 
the included routines is where you actually design your games. The 
neatest thing is you don't have to compile them to try them out, 
you can actually run your games (a little slower..) from the GFA 
INTERPETER. There is really too many things about MAGE to go into 
here, if you want to get technical, we can get technical, but 
let's do it over the phone ok? MAGE provides enough power for 
the more experienced coder but really shines when it comes to 
first time game designers. Using the demo "30 minute game" from 
the MAGE manual you can design your own Galaxian,Invaders type 
game the same day you buy the MAGE system. (seriously...)

The MAGE DEMO

Which brings us to the MAGE Demo programs themselves. To prove to 
you how easy it is to design some vital sections of a game we have 
provided you with the chance to interact with the MAGE editors and 
see for yourself just how easy (and not to mention fun!) it is to 
create a game using MAGE.

The DEMO GAME

The demo game is similar to the one used in the 30 minute demo, 
but we added a few things to it like, music, a fancy demo title 
screen, etc. It's a simple shooter that's fun to play. It was 
designed in about 2 hours one evening. 

Tech talk: This may go over a few heads but I had to get this in. 
In the title screen demo, the MAGE sprite engine is cranking out 
at 60 frames a second with a star field and some music playing in 
an interupt. I wanted to get this in incase any hackers out there 
thought MAGE wasn't up to speed so to speak.

Boot this thing already....

Now is probably a good time to run the demo game just to see what 
the heck it is you will be playing with later on. The editors only 
work in low res but MAGE allows your games to be launched from 
almost any resolution. (Except True color mode on the Falcon)
See the fancy title screen with those little sprites buzzing 
around? Actually, the loop handling that section is only about 10 
lines long. You see, the main engine used by MAGE is a fast 
compact machine language kernal. It takes care of all the pattern, 
tracking, direction, ect. sprite movement for you. All you have to 
do is pass a few parameters to the proper GFA BASIC PROCEDURE. 
Pretty simple really, but actually pretty amazing how well it 
works. 

Anyway, press the joystick button to play the game. Notice the 
background? You might at first think this is picture drawn from an 
art package like Degas right? Nope..this entire screen was 
designed using the character editor to first create some 
characters and then we used the map editor to place them in the 
correct character location. The planets are made out of multiple 
cells! The patterns that the sprites use to move around were 
designed using the anim editor and the mouse. Using the included 
demo versions of the MAGE editors you will be able to:

1) Design new character cells to create a new font and background.
2) Use the map editor to place the new cells into a screen layout.
3) Design new sprite images using the character editor.
4) Use the anim editor to draw new sprite paths with the mouse.

Since the game loads all of it's data from disk, now just might be 
a good time to make a back up copy of the demo disk in case you 
need to start over. 

NOTE: Rather than provide you a detailed doc file, we encourage 
you to explore the abilities of the demo editors, if you have any 
questions about these editors please feel free to call.

Character set and sprite images:

Go ahead and boot up the MAGE Character Editor. Here you can load 
the .CP1 and .SP1 files that came with the demo disk. Click on the 
V 1-1 section to flip between the banks of the images. Each 
.CP1/.SP1 file has 200 images, the demo images use 16x10 as their 
grid size so you can flip between 2 banks of 100 to see the entire 
set. Click on a character to edit with the mouse button. Choose a 
color from the color bar and start plotting/drawing with the 
mouse. Press the right button to erase.

Hint: Many MAGE programmers use packages like Degas or Deluxe 
Paint to first draw their images and then use the editor to grab 
them into the image bank. Greatly speeds up the design process.
You can also press HELP to see keyboard commands.

The .CP1 file is the character set where .SP1 is the sprite file. 
Please do NOT confuse these two file types. After you have made 
some modifications or created some new images don't forget to SAVE 
them to disk so you can see them in action when the demogame gets 
run again. The character editor demo has been modified to save 
16x10 images for use by the demo game only.

NOTE: Do not change the order of where the images are located. If 
you alter the cell locations of these images, strange things will 
surely happen when the demo game is run.

The MAGE Map Editor:

The MAGE Map editor is really a breeze to use, adter loading the 
editor click on LOAD and then CP1. Click on the DEMOGAME.CP1 file, 
next do the same procedure but load the MAP data this time. You'll 
be asked if you really want to do this because it will erase any 
existing work, say yes to begin your session. If everything went 
well during the load process you are looking at the background 
screen of the demo game. Where are all the drawing tools? There is 
nonce because you aren't really drawing pixel by pixel, here using 
cells you designed with the character editor is where you'll be 
placing those cells onto to a screen to form background patterns 
or complete game backgrounds. The advantage is a regular bit 
mapped screen takes up around 32000 bytes, where as once we define 
our character set we can make up to 255 rooms where each room only 
uses 400 bytes of memory!!! (20x20=400 cells per room)

Ok, so go ahead and click on EDIT. Next you'll see at the top of 
the screen a row of your character set. Move the mouse to the 
EXTREME left and right borders to make the display row scroll 
leeft and right. Move the mouse to the middle of the screen to 
stop the scroll. You may click anywhere on the top row, OR 
anywhere on the screen itself to pick up a cell. This cell then 
becomes the object you can plot anywhere on the screen by pressing 
or holding the LEFT button. The RIGHT button acts like an eraser 
and plots cell number 32(ascii for the SPACE) onto the screen. To 
select another cell to plot press ESC, the top row will be 
displayed again. You can select another cell or press the RIGHT 
button to get back to the main menu. After you have created a new 
background click on SAVE. The new data will be saved to disk and 
when you load the demogame again, it will use this new background 
data! You can press HELP to have access to all the keyboard 
commands.

The map editor allows you to create virtual worlds several times
the size of your ST monitor. The background screen for the 
demogame is rather primitive because the sprites aren't really 
interacting with it. Even though it would be easy to tell if a 
sprite ran into a star or one of the planets, but that's not very 
pratical for this type of game. The MAGE map editor really comes 
into it's own when you start designing platform games or maze 
games. The background data in games like MS_MUNCHIE or 
DARK PEARL were designed using the map editor. This allowed the 
programmer to check which cell the sprites were moving over, thus 
easily checking for power pills, or in the case of DARK PEARL 
making sure there was a cell there otherwise the pearl would just 
fall through the floor! So designing wallpaper backgrounds like 
the one used in the demogame is rahter easy, but it by no means 
displays the full power of the map editor.

The MAGE Animation Editor:

Using this tool you will be able to create new patterns for the 
sprites to follow during the demo game. After you load the 
animation editor (from low res ofcourse) the first thing you'll 
need to do is load the sprites. Click under LOAD on SP1. Next 
under GPA click on LOAD to install the GPA animation data. You'll 
see that there are several animation and pattern sequences 
designed. What we want you to do is draw some new patterns! First 
a little warning though.

WARNING! The animation editor will only save up to what number is 
being displayed. You may freely click on the arrows to cycle up 
and down through the items but when it comes time to save your 
work make sure the number displayed at the total number of anims 
and patterns is at the last one. MAKE SURE you store the original 
data in safe place before editing the data (GPA) file.

The demo game uses 11 patterns. The first 10 are the ones used 
during the game to represent the different waves. The last one 
(11) is used during the title screen sequence. 

Under PATTERN click on edit. Next you'll be asked if you want to 
use the keyboard or mouse. For pattern creation it's best to use 
the mouse. Next, locate a good starting point and HOLD DOWN the 
mouse button and draw the path. (The sprite will use the current 
animation if available.) Each pattern can have up to 500 points, a 
bell will sound when you are getting close to the end. The faster 
you move the mouse the faster the sprite will appear to move. 
Don't move it to fast though, then your animation gets a little 
chuncky looking. Keep the movements smooth and fluid for best 
results. You can press ESC to abort. After you create your pattern 
click on PLAY to see it in action. Simple! Repeat this task for 
all 10 patterns and then SAVE the data, make sure you set the 
counter at 11 for 11 TOTAL PATTERNS!! And then load up the demo 
game and see your new patterns in use.

We realize this only gives you a small taste of what it's like to 
actually use these editors and how much fun it is to design YOUR 
OWN game from start to finish, but if you find yourself tinkering 
with these editors and getting just a tad more curious about the 
MAGE package why not give us a call or better yet, give your local
