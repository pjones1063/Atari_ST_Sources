                                INTRODUCTION

ButtonzBasic¿  was created to make programming in GFA Basic¿
easier, not a tutor program but a utility in which all of the standard
chores of programming and compiling, moving around files, setting compiler
options, etc...are done with ease.  The Menu program that came with
GFA Basic½ was not really meant to be a fully functional work area, but
a tool to get you started.  ButtonzBasic¿ IS intended to be a fully
functional work area.  The things which make ButtonzBasic¿ more useful
are the configuration options that can be saved for future sessions,
a simple click of a button to get you going from editing to compiling and
linking with as many objects as you desire.  Not only this but disk
commands if you are not using other accessories which have disk commands
available.  Also ButtonzBasic¿ supports all ST resolutions in the same
program.


                               SPECIAL NOTICE

Before we start with the program, I want to take just a moment of your
time to thank all of our BETA testers for their time and effort.  Many of
the features of this program were brought about by the suggestions of
of the BETA testers.  Also, many bugs were stamped out by the devotion
and their attention to minute detail.  The BETA testers (in no special
order) are Wayne Watson, Dave Hubbell, Russell Rhoades, Larry Scholz and
Burt Lee.  A big thank you goes out to these special guys!


                               MAIN SCREEN 


ACCESS ACCESSORIES:

        The access accessories button lets you get to your accessories.
To exit from your accessories, just select the GOTO ButtonzBasic¿ item
and you are back at the main screen.


SELECT:

        The select button lets you select the GFA Basic½ file that you
wish work on.  This is the file name that the EDIT button uses also. 
The default source directory initially comes.  You may change the default
source directory from here.


COMPILE:

        The Compile button lets you compile the GFA Basic½ file that was
selected using the SELECT button. ( This lets you compile different
modules separately. and later link them all together.)


LINK:

        This button links all objects in the object list to make an
executable program.


COMPILE & LINK:

        The compile and link button does exactly that, it combines
the compile and link buttons into one.  By selecting this button, you
may create an executable program in one easy step.


EDIT:

        The Edit button takes the file name you selected with SELECT
and passes this file name to the GFA Basic½ Editor that you selected from
the OPTIONS screen.  Also, the Edit button changes the current default
directory to the Source directory, which you selected in the OPTIONS
screen.  If you make a file selection, your Source directory will
now be the current file directory.


COMPILE STATUS:

        Compile status is a history of the most recent Compile, Link
or Compile & Link operation.  This lets you know what happened the last
time you did one of these operations.


SAVE CONFIGURATION:

        This is the button that lets you save this current screen
selection and the Compile Options.


EXECUTE PROGRAM:

        Well now, any idea what this button might do?  Not to hard is it!
If you have the memory you can execute ANY program you want from here.


GFA TO:

        This button lets you toggle through the available file types
that can be compiled.  Ie... TTP, TOS, PRG, ACC.

PRG NAME:

        If you wish the LINKed Program to have a different file name
than the source code name, select this BUTTON and enter the custom
name.   (This name is not saved from session to session.)


COMPILE OPTIONS:

        This button brings up a pop-up window that gives you the
available compiler options.  Select by pressing the appropriate toggle
button.  Default options are all in the up right positions.
 

SETUP:

        This sends you to a new screen and allows you to create a
configuration file.  The selections are for your GFA½ library, basic 
editor, compiler, linker, source directory, personal text editor,
resource editor, and the object list.  The objects can be added or
deleted.  GFA½, by default, uses TEST.O.  You can add whatever other
objects you create to be linked into your code. (Warning: you MUST
have at least one object in your list!)  


TEST:

        This is the button that executes your compiled program
as if it was run from the DESKTOP.  If all went well, you will return
back to the MAIN SCREEN after your program terminates.


DISK:

        This button sends you to another screen that lets you do file
operations like free space, copy, move, delete, etc..., there is also
a FORMAT button that lets you custom format floppy disks.


MEMORY:

        The Memory button will display the total memory in your system,
memory used up so far, and the memory available to you at the moment.


PERSONAL EDITOR:

        Programmers all hate to type docs and data files, but at some
point in time we have to do it, right?  So this button is used to get
to your favorite text editor.  The Text Editor you select in the 
SETUP OPTIONS will be used.

 
QUIT:

        Another toughie?


ButtonzBasic¿:

        Well, you know there has to be an "ABOUT BOX", right!  I mean,
you have to know our names so you can buy other products from us,
and know who wrote it and all!.  Also a good place to put the version
ID and Serial Number.


                                -> NOTE <-

        The compile, link, and compile & link buttons all change
the Compile status window.  The status window only has a one step
history.


                            SETUP OPTIONS:


ACCESS accessories:

        The access accessories button lets you get to your accessories.
To return to BUTTONZBASIC¿, select the GOTO BUTTONZBASIC¿ item from the
DESK dropdown menu, and you're back at the SETUP OPTIONS screen.


ADD OBJECT:

        This is one of those handy features of ButtonzBasic¿.
You can add object files to the OBJECTS list, and these objects will be
linked together to create your executable program.  If you want the main
source code to be created into a program, you must have a object
called TEST.O in the list or nothing will be created.  The TEST.O is the
name that GFA½ Compiler creates to be linked.


DELETE OBJECT:

        To delete an object, first select the object in the LINK listing.
Then click on the DELETE OBJECT button.  This removes the object from the
LINK list, so that it will not be compiled into your program.


NO/USE 10K KERNAL:

        The default setting of this button is "NO 10K KERNAL".  This is
the setting used for machines that have two megabytes of memory or more.
If your machine has less than two megabytes of memory, select the
"USE 10K KERNAL" option, and the shell will only load in one module at
a time.


SELECT LIBRARY:

        This is where you can select which library to use to link
files, in the creation your programs.  Simply press the button and the
file selector will appear.  Find and select your library and click on
OK.  Now ButtonzBasic¿ knows where your library is kept. (NOTE: the
standard GFA½ library is GFA3BLIB.)

 
SELECT EDITOR:

        Selecting of the GFA½ Editor will let ButtonzBasic¿
know where your GFA½ Editor is located at. (NOTE: The standard
GFA¿ Editor is named GFABASIC.PRG.)


SELECT COMPILER:

        Selecting of the GFA½ Compiler will let ButtonzBasic¿
know where your GFA½ Compiler is located.  This is also a good
way to use different compilers such 3.6, 3.5 or 3.0.
 (NOTE: The standard GFA½ Compiler is named GFA_BCOM.PRG.)


SELECT LINKER:

        Much the same as compiler, just select the linker. 
        (NOTE: The standard GFA½ Linker is named GL.PRG.)


RESOURCE EDITOR:

        This button executes the resource editor that you selected in
the SETUP screen.


SOURCE DIRECTORY:

        This is where we select the default source directory for
ButtonzBasic¿.  This directory will come up when you select the SELECT
button in the main screen.  The source directory becomes the last path
you selected with the SELECT button.  This allows your program to execute
as if it were launched from the DESKTOP.


SELECT TEXT EDITOR:

        The Personal Text Editor button on the MAIN SCREEN calls
the program you've selected here.


THE LIST BOX:

        The LIST BOX can be scrolled one line at a time or a page
at a time.  Use the single arrows to move one line at a time, or
the double arrows to move a page at a time.


                            -> NOTE <-
Remember to use the SAVE CONFIGURATION button before leaving
this screen or all changes will be lost.
