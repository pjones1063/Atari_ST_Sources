Within the Autofolder of GFA Basic is a program called IMUNE.PRG.

This program will run automatically each time you boot and look
for any virus on the boot sector. If a virus is found, IMUNE will
remove the virus program from the boot sector.

To be sure of not contracting a virus, always do a cold boot 
with your ST if you have booted with a disc of unknown or suspect 
origin.

We hope that IMUNE.PRG will help give you some protection.
