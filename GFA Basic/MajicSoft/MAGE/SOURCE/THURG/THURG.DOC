                             Game Overview

     Thurg N Murg is a platform game in which the goal is to pick up the
Ziggy rings (the small ruby rings).  Once all the Ziggy rings have been
collected you may advance to the next level.  If you complete the level
before the timer (green bar at the bottom of the screen) runs out, you
will be given a bonus screen.  Thurg can fire, jump and run.  These
powers can be enhanced by collecting potions (shot speed), Super Ziggy
Rings (big blue rings) and other pickups described below.  If Thurg is
caught by a monster, he loses all enhanced abilities.

                                Options

Child Mode        - Characters move slower but you maintain proper
                    speed. All monsters are easier to destroy.
Adult Mode        - Default playing mode.  Cancels child mode.
One Player        - One player game, uses Joystick 1.  Joystick 1
                    pressing fire can also activate this function.
Two Player        - Two player game, uses both joysticks.  Joystick 0
                    pressing fire can also activate this function.
Music             - Music will play during game.
FX                - Sound effects are active during game.
50/60Hz           - Flexible setting of VSYNC rates.

                                Pick Ups

Ziggy Rings       - Collect them all to complete a level.
Super Ziggy Rings - Gives you the ability to fire an additional shot.
                    Once you can fire three shots all additional Super
                    Ziggy Rings give you bonus lives.
Potions           - Increase shot speed.  These add up so that a smart
                    player can get AWESOME shot abilities.
Poisons           - Look slightly different from potions, you lose a
                    life if you touch one.
Pickups           - These give you extra points.
Nurkel Footwear   - Speed enhancer.
Pogo Stick        - Extra jumping power.
Shield            - Protects you from everything but poison potions.
Timer Expander    - Stops the timer.  Good in a two player game!

                              The Monsters

Mondo Monkeys     - They are fast and tricky.  Gain armor in upper
                    levels.
Ted E. Bears      - Strong but dumb.  Can be hard to destroy.
Scooter Kids      - Fast and SMART (They look dumb because they walk
                    backwards).  Be careful because they are all over
                    you in seconds!!
Street Wabbits    - As smart as Scooter kids.  They are tougher, slower
                    and can jump VERY high.  A couple of these can
                    really make a mess!
Baggins Dragons   - The are slow and cannot jump.  Their fireballs and
                    intelligence more than make up for these
                    deficiencies.  BEWARE: Dragon fireballs do NOT have
                    to touch you in order to hit you (They're so hot!).

                                  Tips

* Stay below Mondo Monkeys because they jump so fast.
* Ted E. Bears must be ambushed or they will absorb enough firepower
  to walk up to you.
* Dragons can be lured around the screen.  NEVER stand above a dragon
  because it can shoot through platforms.
* Destroy Scooter Kids and Wabbits first.  They are your most active
  enemies.
* There ARE hidden screens.  Not performing some very tempting actions
  are rewarded richly in this game.
