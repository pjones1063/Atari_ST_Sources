        The year is 2525 and man is still alive.  But his very existence is
threatened.  Cybernetics is real and cybernetic organisms are a very real
part of the society of the current age of man.  That is where you fit in.

        Your job as "Inspector Sleuth" is to insure that the cybernetic 
organisms remain under human control.  You make routine inspections of
different industrial manufacturing facilities to insure that no one is
breaking the rules.  Those rules being - cybernetic organisms may only be
manufactured as non-violent work horses.

        In the past few years there have been rumors from the underground
of a scientist named Dr. Spirit.  Rumors say that he has developed a method
of transplanting human minds into a new generation of cyberdroids he has
created.  And that he is using these new cyberdroids to capture humans to
use in his evil experiments.  Other rumors say that he has a huge military
complex setup up and that this complex is now a factory for producing an
ultimate army of cyberdroids.  Captured humans are being slaughtered by the
hundreds and their minds are being used in these cyberdroids to form his
armies.  

Intelligence reports say that Dr. Spirit has designed at least four
generations of cyberdroids and that the designs of a new generation is now
underway.  The information you have compiled is:

MAKE              MODEL        DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cyberdroid MK I:  Hemroid      Low Level Intelligence, general pain in butt.
Cyberdroid MK II: Red Hemroid  Low Level Intelligence, armed with weapon.
Cyberdroid MK III:Spinroid     Med Level Intelligence, tracking onboard.
Cyberdroid MK IV: Grn Spinroid Med Level Intelligence, tracking and armed.
Cyberdroid MK V:  Hopperoid    Hi  Level Intelligence, ultra track and warp.
Cyberdroid MK VI: Spirit       DR. Spirit Himself,     fast, auto laser!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your assignment:

      Using a special key card you have attained, you shall infiltrate
Dr. Spirit's factory complex and destroy him.  The government has armed you
with a special hand gun that launches small armor piercing projectiles.

      These special projectiles are armed with a small thermo nuclear device
that will explode on impact, destroying even the toughest materials now
in existence.

      Dr. Spirit's complex is rumored to have many levels of fortification.
It is recommended that you take with you a mapping device (Hi-Tech Graph
Paper will do).  As you work through this complex you may find locked doors
that will only open with the proper keys.  Also rumor has it that you may
find mystery devices that can award you with keys for the doors or even extra
lives.  Rumor has it that many exciting and new devices may be found in this
complex.  

Special Note: New information indicates that Dr. Spirit has electrified all
              of the walls in the complex, so be careful.

Special Keys: F1  - toggles Novice/Expert Mode.
              F10 - toggles 50/60 htz.
              P   - pauses the game.

"Sleuth" may only be played with a joystick.

Good luck Sleuth, you are going to need it!
