                             SPRITE DESIGNER


             Create sprites and animated characters for your arcade
                 games with Robert Warnestam's powerful utility


Boot up almost any arcade game and one thing hits you smack between the eyes -
the superbly animated sprite-like characters whizzing around the screen at
breakneck speed. True sprites are generated by special hardware inside
computers, but unfortunately the ST doesn't have any hardware support. However,
by using some clever 68000 machine code programming it's possible to simulate
sprites.
    Writing a super-fast sprite handling subroutine from scratch is a complex
and time consuming task, and you probably want to get on with writing the game
rather than fiddling with sprite code trying to wring out the last once of
performance. All your sprite handling problems are now behind you because here
is a sprite editor that enables you to create your own designs and save them to
disk.
    When you have finished you have a choice of several fast and flexible
sprite draiung routines that can be used to animate your creations. The source
code is provided along with executable programs that can be run from the
desktop. What more could you ask for?
