  A full-function scientific desktop calculator with wormhole



WARNING:  read caveats at the end of this document.

Fleabyte\ffs is, like the simpler Fleabyte\sx, an accessory 
capable of transferring information directly to the cursor posi
tion on an application or to another accessory.  The following 
lines have been placed here (on my monitor, that is) directly 
from Fleabyte:

          -log(4.5*10^-5) = 4.346787486225
          10^(1/ln(10)) = 2.718281828459
          sin(.1234)^2+cos(.1234)^2 = 1
          asin(.2756) = 0.2792138193003
          asin(.2756) = 15.99777342763ø

The problem statements were typed in on Fleabyte, answers were 
then obtained by pressing the RETURN key.  After that the copying 
on the application was done by first pressing ESC (to open the 
"wormhole," which is a conduit between accessory and program) 
and then clicking the left mouse button (to activate the window 
of 1st Word Plus whence this is printed).  If I had elected to do 
so, I could have transferred answers only, e.g.

          15.99777342763ø

The following notes supplement details provided in FLEAB_SX.TXT.  

This calculators includes the following functions:

        abs, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, log, and ln 

These are to be entered in lower case with the corresponding 
arguments bracketed - see above.  This calculator has not been 
programmed to receive expression such as sin^2(.1234).  One 
enters instead (sin(.1234))^2 or sin(.1234)^2.  The latter mode, 
though simpler, may be considered as going against current 
convention.  I intend to wait for user comments and suggestions 
before considering this point further.  In the meantime it ought 
to be obvious that, like with any calculator, an analysis of the 
tool's precision must be made before using this accessory for 
high-precision applications.  (I intend to do it as soon as time 
permits.)

I have played with a toggle for choosing between degrees and 
radians.  It appears to me that the typing in of either a d or 
an r better suits our natural bent.  Do tell me if you find me 
wrong - or right.

Here are a few reminders on the use of the wormhole.  The choice 
of transferring to an application a complete expression or just 
an answer is made by using "=" as a toggle between wh:l and 
wh:b.  Those transfers consist of two parts:

     1.  Placing the calculation set-up and response in an in- 
and output buffer, which is not associated with either the 
accessory or the application program even though the code for the 
segment appears here in the accessory.

     2.  After deactivating the accessory and activating the 
window of the application program, the buffer discharges at the
cursor position.  And, of course, if it has a prior opportunity 
to do so, it will discharge at the cursor position on the 
accessory.  The operation, though instigated by the accessory, 
does not remain under the accessory's control.  Pressing the ESC 
key interrupts a cycle of GEM "events" and thus permits the 
computer to deliver the buffer contents to the cursor position of 
whatever application comes up next.
   
Whether or not this works, therefore, depends not only on this 
accessory, but on the destination as well.  I have used it 
successfully with "1st Word Plus," "Word-Up," "Word Perfect," 
and with "LDW" Spreadsheet.  But there are applications that plug 
the wormhole at the other end.

The wormhole will transfer 62 characters at a time.  The full 
length of calculation set-up plus answer may be 77 + 15 = 92 
characters.  Lines longer than 62 characters are split.  After 
the first part is sent, click on the accessory to get the 
second part into the wormhole, then click again on the applica
tion.  Smooth, man, smooth.  Although Fleabyte could have been 
programmed with a longer buffer so that the whole transmission 
might take place in one shot, it seems like asking for trouble 
when working between applications.  Unless one doesn't mind a 
couple of bombs.  Any expert advice?

If you have a program listing (FLEAB_SX.LST or FLEAB_FF.LST) 
notice that I let the very first transmission after boot-up 
begin with eight markers.  These are somehow papered over during 
the first transfer by, presumably, either GEM or Fleabyte.


CAVEATS:  Avoid entering an application (e.g. a word-processor) 
while Fleabyte is on-screen.  Also avoid pressing keys for 
repetitive action when Fleabyte is used together with an applica
tion.  I have had a three-bomb problem here, but it was associa
ted with one particular word-processor I used for testing this.  
I have not encountered any problem with 1st Word Plus nor did I 
with Word-Up.

Again I like to ackowledge the support and help of fellow 
members of M.A.S.T., the Montreal Atari ST users' group and in 
particular Mark Cummins and Leo Scalia.  A special thanks to 
Jonathan Seldin who was so kind to see if he could bomb the 
program.  Thus he has saved from a horrible fate those users who 
intend to calculate the tangent of a 90.00000000001-degree angle.
