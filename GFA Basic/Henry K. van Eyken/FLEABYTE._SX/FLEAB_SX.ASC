              A simple desktop calculator capable of 
        communicating directly with other running programs


WARNING:  read caveats at the end of this document.

Fleabyte/sx is an accessory capable of transferring information 
directly to the cursor position on an application such as a word-
processor or spreadsheet or on some other accessory such as 
EdHak's "Diary."  The following three lines have been placed 
here (on my monitor, that is) directly from Fleabyte:

          12.345 * 678.9 = 8381.0205
          (123 + 456) : 789 = 0.7338403041825
          1/2 * 2/3 = 0.3333333333333

The problem statements were typed in on Fleabyte, the answers 
obtained by a press of the RETURN key, and then the entire 
calculation were transferred by first pressing ESC (to open the 
"wormhole," which is a conduit between accessory and program) 
and then clicking the left mouse button (to activate the window 
of 1st Word Plus whence this is printed).  If I had elected to do 
so I could have transferred answers only, e.g.

          0.3333333333333

That choice is made by entering "=" followed by a press of the 
RETURN key.  The "=" serves as a toggle from "long mode" (problem 
statement plus answer) to "brief mode" (answer only) and vice-
versa.  These modes are indicated on the ruler by [wh:l] and 
[wh:b].  Enter the calculation when in the desired mode.  Calcu
lations may include a note, for example:

          .25 mol (COOH)2.2H2O!  .25* [2* (12.0+ 2* 16.0+ 1.0) + 
2* (2* 1.0+ 16.0)] = 31.5

The line-wrap was done by the word-processor, but because this 
is a long line, the transfer from Fleabyte was done in two steps 
and, therefore, required three mouse clicks instead of one (i.e. 
one on the application, then one on Fleabyte, then one again on 
the application.)

Transfers are accomplished with the XBIOS(14,1) or iorec() func
tion (see, e.g., Sheldon Leeman, "Atari ST, Vol. 3: TOS," 
Compute!'s Technical Reference Guide, 1987) and Gottfried P. 
Engels, "Concepts in Programming," Michtron.  They consist of 
two parts:

     1.  Placing the calculation set-up and response in an in- 
and output buffer, which is not associated with either the 
accessory or the application program even though the code for the 
segment appears here in the accessory (see PROCEDURE wormhole).

     2.  After deactivating the accessory and activating the 
window of the application program, the buffer discharges at the
cursor position.  And, of course, if it has a prior opportunity 
to do so, it will discharge at the cursor position on the 
accessory.  The operation, though instigated by the accessory, 
does not remain under the accessory's control.  Pressing the ESC 
key interrupts a cycle of GEM "events" and thus permits the 
computer to deliver the buffer contents to the cursor position of 
whatever application comes up next.
   
Whether or not this works, therefore, depends not only on this 
accessory, but on the destination as well.  I have used it 
successfully with "1st Word Plus," "Word-Up," "Word Perfect," 
and with "LDW" Spreadsheet.  But there are applications that plug 
the wormhole at the other end.  I am confident that users will 
rate Fleabyte an excellent tool, but let's be clear, it is not 
yet a tool to be used blindly.  One must first establish clearly 
what evils may lurk at the iorectum!  (To say nothing of my own 
tresspasses while making this accessory.)


How does one get along with Fleabyte?

First, let it be said that - as a calculator - Fleabyte can be 
used either as an accessory or as a program, but the Wormhole
functions only when one can activate another GEM window.  The 
transfer is easiest done when the accessory and the application 
windows slightly overlap.  (At the time of writing this, the 1st
Word Plus window slightly overlaps the top edge of Fleabyte.  By 
working in this manner, one single mouse click will activate 
Fleabyte instantly, ready to receive a calculation.  Thus with 
the overlapping there is one GEM event less to to be concerned 
with.)


Calculations

Clicking on "Fleabyte\sx" (on the desktop info menu) produces
a two-line, ruler-shaped calculator ready to receive a calcula
tion set-up.  After entering it, e.g. 12^6, press RETURN or 
ENTER and the answer appears at bottom-right, 2985984.  It does 
not matter whether one does or does not include spacings within 
a calculation set-up, e.g. whether one enters 2 + 3 or 2+3.

The next pressing of the RETURN key does many things:

          1.  It transfers the answer to the memory-1 (m1)
position after first
          2.  Moves the previous answer from m1 to m2.
          3.  Transfers the calculation set-up with answer to a 
two-dimensional memory array that will hold up to two dozen such 
pairs of information.
          4.  It puts either (a) calculation set-up together with 
answer or (b) just the answer into the wormhole whence it can be 
discharged later if it is not first replaced by another complete 
calculation or just another answer.  (As mentioned the transfer 
is initiated with the ESC key and executed upon the mere presence 
of a curser that is willing and ready.)
          5.  It clears the top ruler of the accessory for a 
next calculation (see the dash-type cursor).


Transfer of long lines

The wormhole will transfer 62 characters at a time.  The full 
length of calculation set-up plus answer may be 77 + 15 = 92 
characters.  Lines longer than 62 characters are split.  After 
the first part is sent, click on the accessory to get the 
second part into the wormhole, then click again on the applica
tion.  Smooth, man, smooth.  Although Fleabyte could have been 
programmed with a longer buffer so that the whole transmission 
might take place in one shot, it seems like asking for trouble 
when working between applications.  Unless one doesn't mind a 
couple of bombs.  Any expert advice?

If you have the program listing (FLEAB_SX.LST) notice that I let 
the very first transmission after boot-up begin with eight 
placeholders.  These are somehow papered over during the first 
transfer by, presumably, either GEM or Fleabyte.  Any expert 
willing to tell me the reason for this? 

Besides an on-screen application program one might also have on-
screen an additional accessory, e.g. Diary.  If that is activated 
instead then that is where Fleabyte's message will go.  In this 
particular instance, though, I found that each time the first 
character entering the wormhole does not show up on Diary.  I 
guess that one (two-byte) position of the iorec function was 
taken over by activating the Diary.  The solution is simple: 
leave the first character blank on Fleabyte so you won't miss it 
on Diary.


Using memory and memo array

One may enter data from m1 or m2 into the calculation by typing 
in m1 or m2:

          m1^(1/6) = 12.00000000001
          m2/m1 = 248831.9999998

(It would be a simple matter to let the calculator type out just 
"12" and "248832," but let's wait first how well this prelimina
ry version of Fleabyte\SX is received and what users will 
express as their preferences.  It will also be a simple matter to 
have the variables m1 and m2 be replaced by their values, but, 
here again, I prefer to wait for user reactions.)

Typing in a question mark followed by RETURN (or ENTER) will 
produce an item from the memory array.  The memo's sequential 
number and the total number of memos in use are shown in the 
center of the bottom line.  One can move forward in the memory 
array by either pressing the RETURN or the ">" key; one can go 
the other way by using the "<" key.  One can transfer an answer 
from a displayed calculation by pressing "m" or "M".  This will 
shift the answer to m1 while m1's existing contents are shifted 
to m2.  By pressing "m" or "M" one also leaves the memo array 
so as to get on with the next calculation.

The array is currently made to hold 24 items.  Subsequent items 
cause the array to jettison the oldest item.  When "?" is 
pressed, the array is entered at the middle position to equally 
facilitate reaching its upper and lower reaches.  It is, of 
course, a simple matter to make a bigger or smaller array, or 
even two arrays, one for temporary items and one for more 
valuable stuff that may then be sent off to disk, but I shall 
not succumb to that temptation now.  Instead I shall first await 
users' reactions.           


Note-taking

Brief notes can be entered in two distinct ways:

          1.  With a calculation, - see the above example of 
calculating the weight of a quarter of a mole of oxalic acid, 
(COOH)2.2H2O.  The note must be followed by an exclamation 
point.  Fleabyte sends to its calculation routine only that what 
comes after this mark.
    
          2.  A stand-alone note.  This requires an exclamation 
point for opener:

          !Elisabeth needs the car next Wednesday.

The RETURN button will send this note straight off into the memo 
array.  The answer part of the array will remain empty.


Leaving and reentering Fleabyte

After a calculation is entered and the RETURN key is pressed for 
the answer, one may proceed in various ways:

          1.  One can press RETURN or ENTER again for a subse
quent calculation or press either one once more to deactivate 
and leave Fleabyte.  Thus it is not necessary to proceed with a 
calculation even if the cursor is waiting for one to be entered.

          2.  As mentioned a press on ESC transfers the calcula
tion into the wormhole for potential discharge at a cursor 
position as soon as a GEM "event" such as a mouse click occurs.

          3.  That pressing of ESC or the pressing of any other 
key but the RETURN and ENTER keys will break the calculating 
cycle and the accessory can be closed (click on "close box," top 
left) or moved (drag by its "move bar") or simply deactivated by 
clicking on another program's window.

The calculator can be reentered either by clicking on the 
"fuller box" to the right of the "move bar" or, if an applica
tion partially overlaps it, by clicking on the Fleabyte window.
Clicking on the "fuller box" also empties the wormhole so as to 
avoid Fleabyte feeding into itself.


Error messages

Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.  Counting on a reasonable user, 
no attempt has been made to make Fleabyte absolutely foolproof.  
That would just enlarge the program and make it more complicated.
As one who still works occasionally with 1.5-K pocket computers 
this goes against the grain.  However some error checking and 
correcting facilities are included.  Thus you will be alerted 
when:

          1.  The number of closing brackets does not equal the 
number of opening brackets.  However, no detailed look is taken 
at the type of brackets involved.

          (4+[12*3)-6} = 34

may offen you, but poses no problems for Fleabyte.  If you get 
the message "check brackets," simply correct the problem without 
reentering the whole calculation.  (The error message gives you a 
few chances to straightene things out, but if you persist in 
going your won way, well, who is Fleabyte to stop you?)  The 
accessory is equally courteous when it encounters some other 
misdemeanors such as the next ones.

          2.  Unintelligible sequences of signs, such as ^^ or /*
or -*.

          3.  Division by zero.

          4.  Roots of negative numbers other than such goodies 
as -8^(1/3) and its ilk:

          -8^(-1/3) = -0.5

Many other errors are so obvious there is little point in making 
special error checking provisions for them.  E.g.  if one enters
)2+4(, the answer will be )2+4(.  No need to deal with this sort 
of thing.  But if, while acquiring experience with Fleabyte, you 
find it to have some less desirable habits, please drop me a 
line.  For my address, press "@" and RETURN.


The Fleabyte Project and a modicum of Fleabyte philosophy

This calculator and some others just about to come "off the line" 
are made available by the Fleabyte Project, a project that seeks 
to gain an understanding of how pocket computers may be helpful 
in education, at work, and in the conduct of one's personal af
fairs.  

"Fleabyte" is a term of endearment for PROGRAMMABLE pocket com-
puters in general.  A rather powerful model, "Fleabyte\dt" repre
sents an experimental desktop stand-in for pocket computers.  
(Note: Version 0.1 of Fleabyte\dt contains some dumb errors.)

If one considers that modern pocket computers have capacities way 
beyond that required by this program, which takes about 20 kb, 
one may well envisage the increasing usefulness of pocket 
computers as personal accessories in everyday life, as useful, 
say, as a watch is today.  (I envisage them eventually fitted 
with two-way radio and/or TV communication for instant access to 
all sorts of information.)  

One aspect of the program concerns automated problem-solving 
routines.  In chemical calculations this makes the automated 
balancing of equations and the automated handling of uncertain-
ties in measured data requisite steps.  So are also forms of 
efficient data transfer among various depositories.  Some of 
this is demonstrated by Fleabyte\dt.  I was stimulated to adopt 
the XBIOS(14,1) function by a recent article in the Dutch 
computer magazine "START," but the technique is, of course, an 
ancient one in ST chronology.

The outcomes of this work may well have a significant bearing 
on education ... in fact, it already ought to have.  However, a
combination of ambient scepticism and cynicism forces me to con-
duct the project with limited personal means of time, energy  and 
money.  Your contribution in the form of a small "shareware" 
payment of, say, $15 (depending on your affection for Fleabyte 
and the depth of your pockets, and, better still, supplemented 
with some good, preferably well worked-out idea will be most 
welcome.  I should hope that educational institutions and busin
ess people who make use of this item will do a little better.

I doubt the project will ever provide me with a livelihood, and 
that certainly is not my intention, but it would be nice if at 
least my financial outlays will be covered.

The Fleabyte programs are intended to be adaptable to people's 
personal needs.  The programs, written in GFA BASIC v. 3.07 are 
or will be available in .LST form.  In the meantime, these are 
some calculators about to be completed and released:

          Fleabyte\ffs, a full-function scientific calculator.

          Fleabyte\sf, also a full-function, scientific 
calculator, but one that presents results with due attention 
given to significant digits, i.e. to uncertainties in the data 
on which they are based.  This, I suspect, is another first for 
Fleabyte.

          Fleabyte\bsn (basic natural science), like sf, but 
further expanded to include atomic weights and physical con
stants for semi-automated calculations.

          Fleabyte\dt (desk-top) as well as The Wormhole (an 
invisible calculator working out directly problems laid-out on an 
application) will continue to serve for experimentation and are 
circulated in the hope they will generate useful feedback for the 
project.  Let's wait and see.


Version 0.8

In the listing for the present program you will find a procedure 
called main which permits one to use Fleabyte either as a program 
or as an accessory.  The program form is meant to be run under 
the GFA interpreter so as to make it so easier to alter the 
present program for personal ends.  Any changes may then be tested
within the GFA BASIC program.  (There seems to me little sense in 
compiling just the .PRG form, but you are a free person and you 
may well have a need I do not now envisage.)

A kind friend put Fleabyte\DT along with another special type of 
calculator, The Wormhole, on a bulletin board and I sent some 
copies off to ST magazines in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and 
Holland.  They carry the version number 0.1, which means "don't 
trust me blindly."  (Sure enough, two magazines drew my attention 
to errors that prevent their use so as to protect their reader
ship.  Publication was not really intended; instead I had rather 
hoped to engender interest in the purpose behind these calcula
tors.)  The item was circulated for people who appreciate this 
sort of thing - and especially for educators - in the hope of 
generating comments for me to consider in the progress of my 
work.

This version carries the number 0.8, which means that I believe 
it to be in good order, but that I still like to play it safe.  
Life carries no guarantees and does have its nasty turns.  But 
that should not stop attempts at making some progress.  In 
conclusion I like to thank the members of M.A.S.T., the Montreal 
Atari ST users' group, for their frowns and support, especially 
Marc Cummins, Leo Scalia, and John Denton.

CAVEATS:  Avoid entering an application (e.g. a word-processor) 
while Fleabyte is on-screen.  Also avoid pressing keys for 
repetitive action when Fleabyte is used together with an applica
tion.  I have had a three-bomb problem here, but it was associa
ted with one particular word-processor I used for testing this.  
I have not encountered any problem with 1st Word Plus nor with 
Word-Up.
