Documentation for the AutoGEM sample files.

	If you have ORCS you should first use it to look at the SAMPLE.RSC
	file and check the different objects name. If you do not have ORCS
	simply load the SAMPLE.LST file in a text editor or double click
	on it from the desktop to view it. The SAMPLE.LST file was created
	using ORCS, it contains the name of all the objects and other
	information that AutoGEM needs to generate the GFA Basic code.

	The file AUTO_G.LST is the file wich is generated by AutoGEM. In
	this demo version AutoGEM does not produce any code and the
	AUTO_G.LST file is provided for you only as an example of code
	allocation and window processing method. Do NOT try to execute
	this file because 80% of the code has been removed. This file was
	originally made up of 9783 lines of GFA Basic code and it needs all
	of it in order to work properly. You will notice that the first
	part of the code contains all the initialization process and after
	that you'll find procedures for initialisation and GEM events
	processing. After that there is the AutoGEM "standard" program
	info window subprogram procedures. Following are the subprograms
	procedures for each one of the dialogs in the resource file. If a
	dialog contains one or more pop menus the procedures for handling
	each pop menu follows each dialog subprogram procedures. At the
	end you'll find one procedure for each alert box found in the
	resource file. The name of all the procedures and variables in the
	generated code is derived from the name of the objects in the
	resource and each one of the subprogram generated for each dialog
	is well identified for quick location amongst the thousand of
	code lines. Example, if you name a dialog "form_control_panel%"
	there will be a subprogram made up of a number of procedures like
	"open_f_control_panel_window" to open the control panel window or
	"redraw_f_control_panel_window" to redraw the control panel
	window. These procedures can be called at any time because a
	protection is provided in the case of an unopened or untoped
	window, like if you call the "close_f_control_panel" procedure and
	the control panel window is not opened, nothing would happen
	(nothing bad either!). In one of the AutoGEM user manual, you'll
	find the complete listing of 3 applications with all the necessary
	comments to help you understand and modify the generated code.
	Every details is provided on inserting your own code to make your
	program do what you intend it to do.

	The SAMPLE.PRG file is an example of the complete compiled and
	unmodified code produce by the real version of AutoGEM. You will
	notice that all the dialogs are displayed in real GEM windows,
	that you can open as many windows as your system can handle (7 on
	the desktop, up to 100 under Geneva¿, 100 windows is the AutoGEM
	limit). You will also notice that the pop menus do not freeze your
	program or the menu bar and that you can even top another window
	while a pop menu is open!!! This program can run under Geneva¿ or
	Multi-TOS¿ without ANY modification. It can load GDOS or
	SpeedoGDOS¿ graphic fonts. It is able to automatically locate and
	load the necessary resource file depending on computer resolution.


	*** Again, DO NOT try to run the AUTO_G.LST file it is incomplete!
