     AutoGEM is a GFA Basic code generator. This program will use a RSC
     file created  with Otto's Resource Construction Set to create the
     necessary code to make it work in a real GEM environment. The
     resulting code is an ASCII file that must be merged into the GFA
     Basic editor.

     You'll be able to create dialogs with editing fields, buttons,
     switches, movable objects, objects that can be dragged to another
     window, vertical and horizontal sliders, and even pop menus and
     window menus! All this by simply naming your objects in the rsc
     file in a way that AutoGEM is able to understand. The syntax is
     very simple and this will make it easier to recognize and
     understand what is happening with the RSC in your GFA listing.

     The SAMPLE folder contains sample rsc files and executable to
     illustrate the possibilities that AutoGEM offers. The sample
     program was generated and compiled without ANY modification so
     what you see is what you'd get if you have used AutoGEM to process
     the same rsc file yourself (only a variable value was change and
     also 4 lines where removed for reasons too long to explain here).

     The RSC file is processed in 3 steps by AutoGEM;

          - All the necessary code to initialize and quit a
          real GEM environment is created. Also procedures for
          handling the menu bar are created and a quit alert box is
          provided for proper program ending. Procedure for loading
          GDOS/SpeedoGDOS fonts are created.

          - All the dialogs in the RSC file are processed and the
          code to run each of them in a independent real GEM window
          is generated. (a RSC with 30 dialogs will give you a
          program with the possibility to open 30 multitasking
          windows at the same time!!!)

          - Objects in each dialog are processed and the necessary
          code to handle them the way you want is generated. This is
          done by naming your objects in a particular way (read the
          on-line help to know all about that)


     AutoGEM is fast!!! very fast, it can create about 30,000 lines of
     GFA Basic code in about 2 minutes (faster than any human can
     type...). This will produce a 1.3 mega byte file! You'll never
     have GEM troubles again, even if you know nothing about GEM you'll
     be able to make a real GEM program because the code is well
     commented (see the auto_g.lst file). The user manual tells you
     where you can put your own code to make your program do what you
     want with the data collected from your dialogs. Every dialog in
     the generated code is treated like a little program inside the
     "big" program and all the procedure names are derived from your
     RSC objects names. AutoGEM is so wise that it created the code for
     it's own interface...that's about half of the code in AutoGEM!

     The AutoGEM development kit will turn your programs into real GEM
     masterpieces! And its the perfect GEM programming teacher if you
     don't know anything about handling real windows in GFA Basic.

     AutoGEM comes with 3 disks full of code and utilities. A compiler
     /shell that WORKS under Geneva¿. Sample source code for 3 GEM
     application that use GDOS or SpeedoGDOS¿ fonts for printing.
     2 manuals and a quick reference plastic coated card.

     The price is $50 (US) or $65 (CAN) plus shipping.
