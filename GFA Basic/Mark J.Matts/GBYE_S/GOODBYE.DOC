      Right then guys, a very quick and dirty doc file just to get you 
started..  This program is NOT to be released until it has been tested, plus  
I have to write a proper DOC file for it..

      To start with a description of what the program does.. You can have as 
many GOODBYE.??? as you like now and this program will either display one at 
random to the user when they log off or in the order they appear in the CTL 
file, the choice is yours.. It works by keeping all the different 
GOODBYE.??? files in a temp folder under their various names.. ie for my BBS 
screen you would have SYSTEMST.ASC, SYSTEMST.ANS etc, for Ians you could 
have SKULL.ASC, SKULL.VTC etc etc.. What happens is when the program is run 
(best in a batch file after a user logs off) the relevant named file is 
copied into the QBBS text folder and replaces the original GOODBYE.??? file, 
that is SKULL.ANS will be copied into the text folder and also renamed 
GOODBYE.ANS at the same time.. All of QBBS's graphic formats are checked for 
and moved if they exist, that is ASC, ANS, VTC, VTM and VTS..

      As always a CTL file controls the way QBBS GOODBYE works.. The 
following commands are available in this version..


 Syntax : SYSTEMPATH=<full path to system files>
Example : systempath=h:\qbbs\
Purpose : Well, to be honest none yet.. When the final version is released 
          this will be used for the registration check..

 Syntax : TEMPPATH=<path to folder where all files are kept>
Example : temppath=h:\qbbs\utils\goodbye\tempfile\
Purpose : Gives the full path to the folder where all the SYSTEM.???, 
          SKULL.??? etc files are kept..

 Syntax : TEXTPATH=<full path to QBBS's text files [GOODBYE.???]>
Example : textpath=h:\qbbs\text\
Purpose : Tells QBBS GOODBYE where to put the files when it changes any.

 Syntax : INORDER
Example : inorder
Purpose : QBBS GOODBYE picks files at random by default, however if you want 
          to cycle through the named files in the order that they appear in 
          the CTL file just use this keyword.

 Syntax : FILE=<name of temp file [No extension]>
Example : file=systemst
Purpose : You can have upto 100 FILE= commands each followed by a filename 
          with no extension, this file name will represent the different 
          graphic files held in the temp folder, therefore SYSTEMST will look 
          for SYSTEMST.ASC, SYSTEMST.VTC etc.. When INORDER is used the 
          order of the files used starts from the first FILE= command to the 
          last in the CTL file.. Once the last one has been displayed QBBS 
          GOODBYE will start from the first again.. To keep track of where it 
          is a small file called GOODBYE.DAT is created. If this is deleted 
          QBBS GOODBYE will simply start from the first file again..


      The CTL commands can be in any order you like as there is no set 
pattern. There is a sample CTL file to hopefully make things easier to 
understand..


   Right then, thats it.. hopefully very easy to setup and use.. As always 
please let me know of any problems or any ideas.. One I had thought of is to 
include the ability to change more than just the GOODBYE.??? screens, let me 
know what you think..

         Please feel free to mail me at anytime with any problems you may 
be having and also any ideas for new features, also feel free to make any 
donations of any kind (Money, new PD, your own programs etc). I always 
support my programs whether you have registered or not, I think it only 
fair since you have taken the time to use them :-)
