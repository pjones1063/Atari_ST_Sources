                        - This Program Is SHAREWARE -


      A small utility for a QuickBBS Bulletin Board System that automatically 
counts any system downloads and adds a total to the FILES.BBS description. 
When your DOWNLOAD.LOG file is deleted this count is not reset, just added to 
every time the file is downloaded.

                     - How To Use It And Where To Put It! -

      Using the program is easy. Either run after a user has logged off or 
once a night, possibly at E-Mail clean up time. In reality you could run it at 
any time because DL_TOTAL will always know which download entries in your 
DOWNLOAD.LOG file are new so it will add these to the totals, even if the 
downloads are from months ago, all depends on whether you keep you log file or 
delete it very month. *** IMPORTANT *** DL_TOTAL creates a small LOG file of 
its own called DL_TOTAL.LOG. It uses this to record the downloads that have 
already been checked. If you delete this file DL_TOTAL will add EVERY 
downloaded file in your DOWNLOAD.LOG. If you delete your DOWNLOAD.LOG then 
DL_TOTAL.LOG will automatically be reset.

      Where to put it? No comments please... Simply place the program into the 
same directory as DOWNLOAD.LOG, and thats it..

      Version 1.0 of DL_TOTAL came with fixed bracket types but with v1.1 you 
can now define which you want to use out of a set of 5. This is simpley done 
by passing a command when running the program from your batch file.. Another 
intelligent feature of DL_TOTAL v1.1 is the ability to detect different 
bracket types to the one you use and then convert them. DL_TOTAL will convert 
a different bracket set if one exists when it is going to add to that 
particular programs download count.. Another way of doing thi is to pass 
another command which will force DL_TOTAL to change ALL the bracket types 
into the one you have specified.. The commands are as follows:-

-bn  n defines the bracket set you want to use (see below). This will make 
DL_TOTAL use the specified bracket set when adding or updating a download 
count. If it is updating a count with different brackets they will be changed 
to the new format.

-cn  Again n defines the bracket type to use. If this command is used the -bn 
command will be ignored and no download accounting will be done, instead 
DL_TOTAL will scan every file description for existing bracketed download 
counts and convert them to the defined set.. For this function to work you 
MUST create a path file called CHNGPATH.CTL which simply holds the full path 
information of where the FILES.BBS files can be found.. The following is an 
example of my CHNGPATH.CTL file..

H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\COMMS\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\QUICKBBS\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\DISKUTIL\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\GRAPHICS\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\MUSIC\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\PACKERS\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\PROGMING\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\GENERAL\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\GAMES\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\HIKER\
H:\QBBS\DOWNLOAD\USERSOWN\

   To use the different bracket sets replace n with the following values..

        1 - ( )       2 - < >      3 - [ ]      4 - { }      5 - ® ¯

      If you use an incorrect value or no number at all DL_TOTAL will use 
type 1 as default.

                         *** VERSION HISTORY ***

v1.0 - Initial Release.

v1.1 - Allows you to define a set of bracket from five available ones. You 
       can now change existing brackets by passing a command.

v1.2 - Dut to a change of format in the DOWNLOAD.LOG file produced by QBBS 
       v1.08 DL_TOTAL didn't recognise new downloads any longer.. This has 
       been fixed and it is now compatible with ALL versions of QBBS..
