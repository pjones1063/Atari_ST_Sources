      Quick-Writer is a multi topic online conferance editor/reader which 
allows your BBS users to add to the topics while they are online. Using 
Quick-Writer is very simple. First you must create a QBBS menu entry for it 
and then on the commandline pass *F *L *G.. This represents the users first 
and last names and their selected graphics style, you can also run 
Quick-Writer from a .DOR file simply by passing the correct parameters.

      The final thing to do is to create (or edit the example) a control file 
called  QUIKWRIT.CTL. This file holds all the path and topic info needed by 
Quick-Writer. The following commands are available.

Command : SYSTEMPATH <path to QBBS system files>
Example : systempath h:\qbbs
Purpose : Quick-Writer uses this path to find all the relevant system files 
          needed for its correct operation.

Command : TEXTPATH <path to the text files>
Example : textpath f:\qbbs\utils\qwikwrit\text\
Purpose : All the text files created will be stored in this folder. If any of 
          the folders do not exist Quick-Writer will create them.

Command : TITLE <topic title> <topic filename> <tearline OPTIONAL>
Example : title Once_Upon_A_Time onceupon ---< Added By %name >---
Purpose : Title names a topic, the file to be used and the format of tearline 
          to be used. Please note that In the topic title *ALL* spaces MUST be 
          replaced by an underscore. You can have upto 9 seperate TITLE 
          commands. You do not need to add an extension to the filename 
          because Quick-Writer will automatically give it a .STY extension. 
          The optional tearline will be added between the text written by 
          each user. If it is not included then all text will be written 
          without any breaks inbetween. The tearline can contain some special 
          parameters which are replaced with various things. The following 
          are available.
          %name  - The users name
          %time  - The present time in HH:MM format
          %date  - The present date in DD:MM:YYYY format
          %full? - A 78 character line of ? character eg, %full*
          %ctr   - Centers the tearline.

          Examples..

          * Added By %name on %date
           --- Will become ---
          * Added By Mark Matts on 03.11.1992

          %full=
           --- Will become ---
          ============= x 78!!

          %ctr---< Written by %name [%date %time] >---
           --- Will become ---
                ---< Written by Mark Matts [03.11.1992 13:52] >---

      If the tearline parameters still seem a little confusing please see the 
example config file for a better idea.

      If you already use a story or conferance creator and want to continue 
using the existing text just put the text file into the folder given by the 
TEXTPATH command then rename it to match the file name for your choosen topic, 
also remember to give it a .STY extension.
