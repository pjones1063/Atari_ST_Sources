[ v1.67beta ]
o Internal tune will now be used if no tunes are matched.
o Command : DEFAULTTUNE <path and filename to *.MUS file>
  Example : defaulttune h:\qbbs\tunes\beguine.mus
  Purpose : Defines the tune to be played if no TUNE command matches the 
            online user. This will override the internal default tune.
o Command : TUNE <name> <path and filename to *.MUS file>
  Example : tune Mark Matts h:\qbbs\tunes\monty_p.mus
  Purpose : Allows you to define a tune for a named person.
o Some Line-A calls were found to be causing problems so they have been 
  removed, these were mainly in the screen handling.
o DEBUG config command added for beta use only. Place DEBUG into your CTL 
  file if SplitZ causes problems. This will create a file which will 
  hopefully help to solve the problem.

[ v1.68beta ]
o Fixed cursor on return from external dos program.
o RS232 and Keyboard buffers were not being cleared correctly. Fixed.
o Cursor switched off before exiting.
