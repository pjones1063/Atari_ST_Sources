         If you use a previous version of SplitZ please forget about it. This 
NEW version has undergone MANY changes, rewrites and has had many additions. 
Due to this I recommend that you read ALL of this DOC file before using or 
trying it as there are many differences between this and previous versions. If 
you tried previous versions and decided not to use it due to the bugs, 
especially in split screen mode, I recommend you try this.. Many online hours 
have been spent testing for any possible bugs and it now seems to be ok, my 
fingers are crossed as I type this. Most of the 'live' testing was done 
between myself on the ST and Mark Butler on a PC running ANSI.SYS.. because of 
this SplitZ will work exactly the same as VT52 graphics mode when running in 
ANSI giving you the FULL split screen capability between different machines..

         SplitZ is, as the name suggests, a split screen chat program for 
using with QuickBBS. It comes with the usual features of many good chat 
programs but with a few other features never found in any other chat 
program before. Many of the features available are SysOp configurable so it 
can be set up to suit your own tastes, and possibly that of your users! The 
standard features include auto detection of the users graphic mode and then 
adjusting its output to match it, also automatically starting in split mode 
if VT52 or ANSI [YES, ANSI] is detected, allowing the SysOp to jump to a CLI 
program from within SplitZ, logging the chat to a text file, switching off 
uppercase characters, dropping the line on the user plus many others. The 
'EXTRA' features found in SplitZ include the ability to show a text file to a 
users from within the chat, a 'fun' mode that can be easily switched on and 
off and the best feature is the ability for an 'INSTANT DOWNLOAD', read on 
for a further explanation of this..

>>>> How to install SplitZ..

         You can place SplitZ anywhere you like, that is on ANY partition and 
in ANY folder. Once installed you must run QConfig and enter the path to the 
SplitZ program under the 'External Chat' heading. That is it, you now have a 
standard SplitZ setup. When a user now tries to page you SplitZ will be run 
instead of the standard QuickBBS chat. If you do not answer SplitZ will let 
QuickBBS know that a failed chat attempt has been made and QuickBBS will then 
display 'Chat!' in its message bar at the bottom of the screen.

         If you want to take advantage of SplitZ's extra features you must 
create two external text files telling SplitZ how you want it to operate.

         The first is called FUNMODE.BBS and controls the 'fun' mode where 
words typed are replaced with others, sometimes this can be quite amusing and 
on other occasions quite embarrassing depending on how you have it set up. 
FUNMODE.BBS is simply a listing of any words that you want changing when the 
'fun' mode is operational. For the 'fun' mode to work the FUNMODE.BBS file 
_MUST_ be in the same folder as SplitZ. It must also use the following format:-

hello<>Wotcha
bye<>Goodbye
qbbs<>QuickBBS
sysop<>Spotty Twerp (!)

         The first word can only be a single word but be in any case, ie, 
upper or lower. This is the word that is changed if it is written. The second 
string of text can be anything you like and not just a single word. How you 
write it here is EXACTLY as it is re-written when replacing the first word. 
Between the word to change and the word(s) to change it to you must place the 
two characters <> in this exact format, basically what it means is change 
this < to that >.. The 'fun' mode can be very useful aswell as amusing.. If 
you find that you are regularly typing the same phrase each time you chat why 
not include shortcut words that will be extended into your most used phrases, 
for example., I am always typing 'BTW' instead of 'by the way' which confuses 
a few users as they do not know what 'BTW' means, therefore one line in my 
FUNMODE.BBS reads..  btw<>by the way .. Makes life much quicker!

         The second external file that you can use to enhance SplitZ is 
called SPLITZ.CTL, which again _MUST_ be placed in the same folder as SplitZ, 
and is used to switch on certain functions or to replace certain standard text 
lines. The format of each command must be exactly as shown below but they can 
be in any order within the CTL file. If you do not want to have, or change a 
feature you simply leave the command out of the CTL file. The available 
commands are as follows:-

Command : SYSTEMPATH <Full path to system files (ie USERS.BBS)>
Example : systempath h:\qbbs\
Purpose : This _MUST_ be in the CTL file.. I do not trust environment 
          variables 100% so this is to make sure the system files can be 
          found.. Without this command SplitZ WILL NOT work..

Command : DOS <Full path and filename>
Example : dos h:\qbbs\utils\dos\pcommand.prg -i -c
Purpose : When you press ALT/J this program will be called. Any parameters 
          needed can be added to the end of the program name. (See example)

Command : TODOSTEXT <Text string>
Example : todostext Hang on a sec.. Just gone to DOS!!
Purpose : This text is displayed to the user when you press ALT/J to run the 
          program defined by DOS=

Command : FROMDOSTEXT <Text string>
Example : fromdostext Hi, I'm back with a vengance...
Purpose : This text is displayed to the user when you return to Splitz after 
          running the program defined by DOS=

Command : PAGELEN <number>
Example : pagelen 15
Purpose : This number defines the amount of seconds Splitz will try to page 
          you. If not used SplitZ will page you for 20 seconds.

Command : GETTEXT <Text string>
Example : gettext Just gone for that DOC file you want to read..
Purpose : Displayed to the user when you are searching for a text file to 
          send to them for viewing.

Command : INSTANTDL
Example : instantdl
Purpose : If used this will enable the 'INSTANT DOWNLOAD' feature which can 
          then be accessed by pressing ALT/I from within any chat mode. No 
          parameters are needed for this command. If it is not used all other 
          CTL commands needed for the 'INSTANT DOWNLOAD' feature will be 
          ignored and pressing ALT/I will have no effect.

Command : INSTDLTEXT <Text string>
Example : instdltext Just gone to get the file you want, back in a mo..
Purpose : This will be the text displayed to the user when you press ALT/I to 
          use the 'INSTANT DOWNLOAD' feature. This will let them know that 
          the BBS hasn't crashed while you go looking for the file that they 
          want to download, or the one that you want to send to them.


Command : DLX <Full path, file name and parameters>
Example : dlx d:\transfer\xyz.ttp -u -c -x *file
Purpose : Specifies the external transfer program to use for X-Modem transfer 
          and the parameters to be passed to it. *file will be replaced with 
          the name of the file you are going to send to the user, it can be 
          anywhere in the parameters line so that different transfer programs 
          can be used.

Command : DLY <Full path, file name and parameters>
Example : dly d:\transfer\xyz.ttp -u -c -y *file
Purpose : Specifies the external transfer program to use for Y-Modem transfer 
          and the parameters to be passed to it. *file will be replaced with 
          the name of the file you are going to send to the user, it can be 
          anywhere in the parameters line so that different transfer programs
          can be used.

Command : DLZ <Full path, file name and parameters>
Example : dlz d:\transfer\xyz.ttp -u -c -z *file
Purpose : Specifies the external transfer program to use for Z-Modem transfer 
          and the parameters to be passed to it. *file will be replaced with 
          the name of the file you are going to send to the user, it can be 
          anywhere in the parameters line so that different transfer programs
          can be used.

Command : DLJ <Full path, file name and parameters>
Example : dlj jekyll.ttp -t1m0k1or1oh3op1oq1z2048 -ph:\qbbs\upload\ *file
Purpose : Specifies the external transfer program to use for Jekyll transfer 
          and the parameters to be passed to it. *file will be replaced with 
          the name of the file you are going to send to the user.

Command : LOCKOUT <Text string>
Example : lockout Sorry, its my turn to say something..
Purpose : Sends the text string to the user when you press ALT/M to lock 
          their keyboard.

Command : F1,F2, upto F10 <Text String>
Example : F2 Welcome to my humble BBS
Purpose : Allows you to assign a text string to the 10 function keys which 
          will be sent to the users screen as if you had typed it..

Command : F11,F12, upto F20 <Full path and filename + any parameters>
Example : F12 h:\turbo\batch\fcshell.prg /icp pcommand.prg
Purpose : Allows you to run any external progam at the touch of a function 
          key. F11 to F20 must be a function key pressed with shift, for 
          example to run program F15 you must press SHIFT + F5.. You can pass 
          parameters by adding them to the end of the filename. (See example, 
          the / is part of the fcshell parameter language, not a part of 
          SplitZ.). Usually the users screen is not cleared when you run an 
          external program, instead they get the relevant message displayed to 
          them. In the case of 'I/O re-direction' programs such as FCSHELL it 
          may be useful to clear the screen so that the user, or yourself if 
          operating remotely, will not have a messed up display. To make the 
          users screen clear you simply place an asterisk (*) after the equals 
          character, for example 'f11 h:\dos.prg' will NOT clear the users 
          screen but using 'f11 *h:\dos.prg' will. There must be no spaces 
          between the asterisk and other characters.

Command : EXTPRGTEXT <Text string>
Example : extprgtext Hang on a second, just running external program..
Purpose : Lets the user know what you are doing rather than letting them 
          think the BBS has crashed!!

Command : ASKCHAT
Example : askchat
Purpose : If used SplitZ will ask the user to type a reason for requesting 
          the chat.

Command : AUTOCLEAR
Example : autoclear
Purpose : Puts the 'autoclear' option in split screen mode ON as default.

Command : USELOG
Example : uselog
Purpose : SplitZ will log certain activities such as the reason for chat, 
          file viewed or downloaded plus other small bits of information in a 
          file called SPLITZ.LOG which will be kept in the same folder as the 
          main SplitZ program.

Command : USERESCAPE
Example : userescape
Purpose : If used the user online will also be able to quit the chat by 
          pressing their escape key.

Command : WELCOME <Text string>
Example : welcome Hi there me old mate..
Purpose : The text string is displayed the user as soon as the chat starts. 

Command : COMPRESSED
Example : compressed
Purpose : Forces SPLIT screen chatting to operate in 9 line mode instead of 
          the usual 10 lines. Pressing ALT/C will still allow you to switch 
          between compressed and decompressed modes.

Command : DEFAULTTUNE <path and filename to *.MUS file>
Example : defaulttune h:\qbbs\tunes\beguine.mus
Purpose : Defines the tune to be played if no TUNE command matches the 
          online user. This will override the internal default tune.

Command : TUNE <name> <path and filename to *.MUS file>
Example : tune Mark Matts h:\qbbs\tunes\monty_p.mus
Purpose : Allows you to define a tune for a named person.

                  ***** DETAILED KEYPRESS DESCRIPTIONS *****

<HELP>- Displays a help screen to the SysOp only which has ALL the available 
        key presses for both users.

ALT/A - Toggles the AUTOCLEAR function either on or off. What AUTOCLEAR does 
        is makes the split windows clear themselves each time the cursor 
        returns to the top line. The user and SysOps windows operate 
        independantly of each other. The bell will ring once for disabled and 
        twice for enabled. The bottom line of text in each window will not be 
        cleared just in case you didn't read it..

ALT/B - Allows the SysOp to clear both split chat windows at one time.

ALT/C - Switches between 9 and 10 line SPLIT screen chat modes.

ALT/D - Allows you to send a text file via the modem so that the user can 
        view it.  The user can control the viewing of the text simply by 
        pressing Y or N to continue viewing or to finish. Viewing of the file 
        is done page by page. When the SysOp presses ALT/D the text string 
        defined by the CTL command GETTEXT= or the default text is sent to 
        the user, the Sysop simply clicks on the file to view using the 
        standard fileselector.

ALT/F - Toggles the 'fun' mode which is only available in the ASCII chat 
        mode. This feature is only used if the FUNMODE.BBS file exists and has 
        valid entries. The bell will ring once for disabled or twice for 
        enabled.

ALT/G - Stops the user ringing your bell when they press CTL/G. Their bell 
        will still ring but yours will be nice and quiet!

ALT/H - If the online user is annoying you or it is time to go to bed you can 
        cut them off and drop the carrier by pressing ALT/H. The user will be 
        sent a random string of garbage which should make them think the phone 
        line had a bad connection and the carrier was lost naturally.

ALT/I - By using a mixture of CTL commands you can send a file to the user 
        directly from within SplitZ using either X,Y or Z-Modem protocols. 
        This is especially useful if whilst having a chat the user mentions 
        that he was looking for a specific file which he couldn't find, with 
        this 'INSTANT DOWNLOAD' feature you can sort it out for him and send 
        it to him within seconds. When you press ALT/I you will be shown the 
        fileselector which you use to click on the file to send to the user. 
        Once the file has been choosen the user will be offered a protocol 
        menu, depending on what you have enabled in the CTL file, offering 
        them the choice of downloading it. Once the download has finished you 
        will both go straight back to the chat screens.

ALT/J - Executes the program specified by the CTL command DOS=. This is best 
        used with a CLI type program. If you only use this feature to move 
        files whilst a user is online I would recommend installing a good 
        replacement fileselector such as UIS3 and then use a small program 
        that calls the Fileselector when run.

ALT/L - Switches the chat LOG feature either on or off. When you switch 
        logging on a folder called CHATLOGS will be created in the folder 
        where SplitZ is (assuming that it doesn't exist).. When a chat log is 
        started a file called CHAT.xxx will be created in the CHATLOGS folder. 
        This file will be unreadable unless you use the file viewer included 
        with this release.. It actually replays the chat session as if you 
        were still on line.. This applies to both chat modes.. When you next 
        open a chat log the next available number CHAT file will be created.. 
        ie, CHAT.000 then CHAT.001 etc etc.. if you delete any then the lowest 
        available number will be replaced with the new file..

ALT/M - My turn!! Locks the users keyboard so that they can type nothing. 
        Gives you a chance to say what you want without any interuptions.

ALT/R - Clears the screen and then redraws it depending on which chat mode 
        you were in. The users screen will also be cleared and then redrawn.

ALT/S - If the online user is operating in either VT52 or ANSI graphics mode 
        you will be able to use either the SPLIT or ASCII chat modes. By 
        pressing ALT/S in either mode you will instantly switch between them.

ALT/U - Prevents the use of UPPERCASE characters all the time. If you or the 
        user are in CAPS LOCK and this function is enabled all words will be 
        written in lowercase apart from the first letter, this allows you to 
        keep names and places capitalised. The bell will ring one for disabled 
        and twice for enabled.

<TAB> - Both users can press this key to clear their own split windows. Both 
        windows will NOT be cleared, only the window of the person who pressed 
        their <TAB> key.

CTL/E - Any text typed after pressing CTL/E will be highlighted. This does 
        not work when the user has selected ASCII graphics mode.

CTL/G - Simply rings the bell on both computers.

<ESC> - Both SysOp and user can quit the chat program by pressing their escape 
        key.

         The bottom of the screen in both chat modes displays the SplitZ title 
text and who the program is registered to, if it is registered that is (hint 
hint), along with the status of various toggles, ie, telling you whether they 
are on or off. In both modes you will also have a constant time display which 
is updated every minute, there is also a counter for how long you have been 
chatting, this should give you an idea of how long the user still has left 
online.. If you are using v1.08 of quickBBS then this is no problem because 
when you exit the chat after the users time is up QuickBBS will ask you if 
you want to give the user more time whereas in older versions it simply hung 
them up.. Good one Theo..

                             *** KNOWN BUGS ***

      After about 2 months of testing on 5 different BBS's we have hopefully 
eradicated most bugs, however, 2 of the testers experianced a problem with 
the middle bar dissappearing when in Split chat mode.. I have been unable to 
recreate or fix this so would deeply appreciate any users telling me if they 
also suffered the same problem. Apart from this all the obvious bugs have been 
fixed although there are likely to be some that will appear once this program 
hits all the different setups available.

                                   --*--

         If you experience any problems or have ANY ideas for new features 
then please put them forward, after all, I can only make the program better 
with your help. It was only due to Mark Butler approaching me with ideas that 
you now have this version. I can be contacted at the following addresses:-

         Please feel free to mail me at anytime with any problems you may 
be having and also any ideas for new features, also feel free to make any 
donations of any kind (Money, new PD, your own programs etc). I always 
support my programs whether you have registered or not, I think it only 
fair since you have taken the time to use them :-)
