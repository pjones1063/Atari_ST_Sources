      PUG will create bar charts showing how much use each of your transfer 
protocols has. There are 4 charts created which are a bar chart of the upload 
protocols, a bar chart of the download protocols, a bar chart of the overall 
protocols used and finally a text chart for all protocols, uploads downloads 
and totals with total files and percentages given. Each of the charts are 
also created in 4 graphic styles, ie ASC, VTC, VTM and ANS.

      To use PUG you must create a CTL file called QBBS_PUG.CTL which must be 
in the same folder as the main PUG program. The CTL file can contain any of 
the following commands in any order.

 Syntax : SYSTEMPATH=<path to system files (download.log & upload.log)>
Example : systempath=c:\qbbs\
Purpose : This is used so that PUG can find the .LOG files. This must be 
          used especially for SysOps who do not use environment variables.

 Syntax : TEXTPATH=<path to folder for files to be created>
Example : textpath=c:\qbbs\text\
Purpose : Tells PUG where to create its graph files.

 Syntax : DLGRAPH=<filename for download graph *NO EXTENSION*>
Example : dlgraph=dwngraf
Purpose : Name of the file to be created for the download graphs. The correct 
          extensions for the corresponding graphic type will be added. If no 
          name is given DL_GRAPH will be used.

 Syntax : ULGRAPH=<filename for upload graph *NO EXTENSION*>
Example : ulgraph=uplgraf
Purpose : Name of the file to be created for the upload graphs. The correct 
          extensions for the corresponding graphic type will be added. If no 
          name is given UL_GRAPH will be used.

 Syntax : OVGRAPH=<filename for overall totals graph *NO EXTENSION*>
Example : ovgraph=ovlgraf
Purpose : Name of the file to be created for the overall totals graphs. The 
          correct extensions for the corresponding graphic type will be 
          added. If no name is given OV_GRAPH will be used.

 Syntax : OVTEXT=<filename for overall totals text *NO EXTENSION*>
Example : ovtext=ovltext
Purpose : Name of the file to be created for the overall text charts. The 
          correct extensions for the corresponding graphic type will be 
          added. If no name is given OV_TEXT will be used.

 Syntax : INC=<Protocol ID>,<Protocol name>
Example : inc=zm,Z-Modem
Purpose : This is used by PUG to check for a protocol in the LOG files. The 
          protocol ID is what PUG checks for in the LOG files and the 
          protocol name is displayed in the graphs. If the protocol name is 
          not given then the ID will be displayed in the graphs. You can 
          define upto 17 different INC= commands. See the example CTL file.

 Syntax : HORIZ
Example : horiz
Purpose : This will make PUG produce it's graphs across the screen rather 
          than down it. If the command is not used vertical graphs will be 
          created.

                        *** Version Information ***

v1.0 - Initial release

v1.1 - Fixed ANSI control character bug for mono screens.

v1.2 - Added the ability to create graphs horizontally and Vertically (Thanks 
       to Andy Styles for that suggestion)


      PUG does not add a 'Press RETURN' prompt so I suggest you use a menu 
type 45 to view the graphs.

         Please feel free to mail me at anytime with any problems you may 
be having and also any ideas for new features, also feel free to make any 
donations of any kind (Money, new PD, your own programs etc). I always 
support my programs whether you have registered or not, I think it only 
fair since you have taken the time to use them :-)
