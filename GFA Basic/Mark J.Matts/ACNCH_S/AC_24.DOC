      What is AUTO CRUNCH?

   AUTO CRUNCH is a QuickBBS utility that will automatically join all your 
FILES.BBS's as one large file. This file can then be packed using standard 
archiving formats, so far it supports LZH, ARC & ZIP, but more formats can be 
added if you send me the archiving utility and a Netmail asking me to do so. 
To make use of the archiving function you MUST have the external program in 
the same folder as AUTO CRUNCH. It also creates lists of NEW files over a 
specified period of days. You can configure Auto Crunch to include a files 
size, date or both by adding a simple command to the CTL file. The file 
descriptions are formatted to match the file info you have included. You can 
create different ALL and NEW file lists by using a simple script file.

      How do I set it up?

   In earlier versions (Pre v2.0) AUTO CRUNCH used 2 control files called 
A_CRUNCH.CTL & AC_PATH.CTL. Now in v2.0 onwards you can still use these files 
as they are (You must add the SYSTEMPATH= command though) or you can create a 
third file called A_CRUNCH.SCP. The .SCP file is like a very simple script 
file that will allow you to create ALL and NEW file lists for different file 
areas if needed. The format of the .SCP file is very simple because all it 
consists of is the A_CRUNCH.CTL (or equivelant) filename to use and the 
AC_PATH.CTL (or equivelant) filename on each line seperated by a comma.. The 
easiest way to understand this is from the following example of an 
A_CRUNCH.SCP file..

ATARI.CTL,ATARI.PTH
AMIGA.CTL,AMIGA.PTH
PC.CTL,PC.PTH

      You must now create a ???.CTL file for each of the filelists to create 
using exactly the same format as for the standard A_CRUNCH.CTL file. The same 
also applies to the .PTH files but they must be the same as the AC_PATH.CTL 
file except with the file areas to be included in the ???.CTL filelist. There 
are example files in the LZH which will give you a better idea.

      Because there is no user input needed the program can be run at any 
time, a good example would be at a mail clean up. The control files MUST be in 
the same folder as the AUTO CRUNCH program. Sample control files are included 
in this LZH file but you may well need to make changes to suit your own setup. 
The entries can be in upper or lower case but can NOT have any comments added. 
The correct syntax of command that can be used in A_CRUNCH.CTL is shown below. 
They can be in any order and any functions not needed can just be left out.

      Please note that in v2.3 the keyword LOGO was used for the 'registered 
to' text referance.. In v2.4 onwards Auto Crunch is now self registering and 
no longer needs this keyword.

SYSTEMPATH=[full pathname to system files.. ie USERS.BBS, QCONFIG.BBS etc]
         Without this command Auto Crunch *WILL NOT* work.. I use this 
         because I do not trust environment variables 100%, plus its useful 
         if you do not have any env vars set..

ALLFILE=[filename without extension]
         This is the name for the files to be created for you all areas 
         listing. Note that it should only be a maximum of 8 characters and 
         should NOT have an extension.

ALLPATH=[full path name]
         This is the full path of where you want the resulting files to be 
         placed. Previous versions of Auto Crunch only allowed a limited 
         length of text for the pathname, now this has been fixed you can have 
         the path as long as you like.

ALLHEADER=[full path + filename]
         This is the full path INCLUDING the filename of a text file that will 
         be included as a header in the final all areas listings. This path 
         can be as long as you like.

ALLFOOTER=full path + filename]
         Exactly the same as above but this is a file that will be appended to 
         the end of the all areas list.

ALLSIZE  The file size will also be included in the file listing if this 
         command is in the .CTL file. The file description will be 
         formatted to match whether the file size is included or not.

ALLDATE  The file size will be included in the file listing and again the 
         text will be formatted to match.


ALLLZH
ALLARC
ALLZIP
ALLTXT
         These four commands activate each type of compression. If you do not 
         want to use a particular type just exclude the command from the CTL 
         file.

NEWDAYS=[number of days to include in the NEWFILES list (numeric)]
         Simply enter the number of days you want to go back for the files to 
         be included. I have tried it set to 60 as you say you have yours and 
         there seems to be no problems. There is no limitation for how far 
         back you can go. It will count back in days, months & years if it has 
         to. This was done so that you can still go back 60 days even when it 
         is January. It will go back into last year so you will always get an 
         accurate 60 day list. THIS WAS A REAL HEADACHE TO WORK OUT HOW TO DO 
         SO I HOPE IT WORKS ON YOUR SETUP AS IT DID ON MINE - IT SHOULD DO 
         ANYWAY.

NEWFILE=[filename without extension]
         The same as for the ALLFILE= command but it refers to the NEWFILES 
         lists.

NEWPATH=[full path name]
         The same as for the NEWPATH= command but it refers to the NEWFILES 
         lists.

NEWHEADER=[full path + filename]
         The same as for the NEWHEADER= command but it refers to the NEWFILES 
         lists.

NEWFOOTER=[full path + filename]
         The same as for the NEWFOOTER= command but it refers to the NEWFILES 
         lists.

NEWSIZE  The file size will also be included in the file listing if this 
         command is in the .CTL file. The file description will be 
         formatted to match whether the file size is included or not.

NEWDATE  The file size will be included in the file listing and again the text 
         will be formatted to match.

NEWLZH
NEWARC
NEWZIP
NEWTXT
         Again each of these commands activate the type of compression 
         required for the new files list.

ALLOFF
         This will completely disable the ALL files option. Any other commands 
         refering to the all files list will be ignored.

NEWOFF
         This will completely disable the NEW files option. Any other
         commands refering to the all files list will be ignored.

USELOG
         This will make Auto Crunch create a LOG file which tells you which 
         files were created and when.

ALLSTAT  A couple of lines will be included at the end of each area within 
         the ALLFILES list detailing how many files there are and the total 
         amount of bytes they take up. Another two lines will be included at 
         the very end of the file giving the same details but with the total 
         values for all the files. The process of creating the ALLFILE list 
         will take a bit longer when this option is enabled.

NEWSTAT  The same as for ALLSTAT but only includes details of NEW files over 
         the amount of days specified by NEWDAYS.

QUIET    Stops most of the scrolling messages therefore making Auto Crunch run 
         a little bit quicker. This is more noticable when used on large file 
         bases.

NOMKFBBS If you use Make FILES.BBS to maintain your FILES.BBS files you can 
         force Auto Crunch to remove the Make FILES.BBS logo box at the end of 
         each areas list by including this command.


*** IMPORTANT *** When you include a filename or path name after a command 
with the '=' sign there must be no spaces between them, for example..  
ALLFILE= allfiles   will not work.  It must be ALLFILE=allfiles for the 
function to work properly.

The second CTL file, AC_PATH.CTL, simply holds the full drive and path name 
for the file areas to be included in the listings. It is assumed the file area 
lists will be named FILES.BBS. AUTO CRUNCH does not check for any other named 
files. The drive letter must be specified if AUTO CRUNCH is to be run from 
another drive. See the sample file for an idea of how it should look - There 
is no limit to the amount of paths that can be added to the AC_PATH.CTL file.

      Thats all there is to it. Once the CTL files have been set up correctly 
the program can be run at anytime of the day (or night).

                      *** External Archiver Names! ***

         Auto Crunch looks for specific file names when it is told to archive 
using a certain type of compression so if your archiver has a different name 
you will have to renmae it. For example, different versions of LZH compression 
programs have been called LHARC.TTP,!LHARC.TTP,LZH201.TTP. If you use the 
correct file names but still have problems creating the compressed files try a 
different version of the compression program. The version numbers that I use 
are shown after each file name. Below is a list of the correct file names for 
each compression that Auto Crunch looks for..

                        Type -  File Name  - Version I Use

                        LZH  -  LHARC.TTP  -  v2.01k
                        ARC  -  ARC.TTP    -  v5.12
                        ZIP  -  ZIP.TTP    -  v1.1


      If you do have any problems with AUTO CRUNCH or if you would like the 
latest version then please leave me E-mail..

         Please feel free to mail me at anytime with any problems you may 
be having and also any ideas for new features, also feel free to make any 
donations of any kind (Money, new PD, your own programs etc). I always 
support my programs whether you have registered or not, I think it only 
fair since you have taken the time to use them :-)
