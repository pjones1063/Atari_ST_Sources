         Welcome the the QBBS FMail system. This program is designed to be 
used as a FILE mailing utility for users of your own BBS. All FMail sent 
can be tagged with a short one line description or message and can only be 
received by the person it is meant for. File transfer are handled by most
external protocol programs which are definable by yourself. As QBBS FMail 
is only for use with QuickBBS it takes advantage of the various settings a 
user may have, namely their prefered graphics mode, screen clearing, 
screen length, etc..

         QBBS Fmail uses two of QuickBBS's files to gain its information 
which are DORINFO1.DEF which should be created when executing QBBS FMail 
from a .DOR file and USERS.BBS where various checks are made to make sure 
FMail is being sent to/from a valid user of the system. Your DOR file 
__MUST__ create the DORINFO1.DEF file in the same directory as your 
USERS.BBS file for FMail to work correctly, this should be the path 
defined by the SYSTEMPATH command in the CTL file..

                      - Setting up the QBBS FMail System -

         The major part of setting up QBBS FMail is creating your 
FILEMAIL.CTL file. This file controls things such as the path to youe 
system files (USERS.BBS & DORINFO1.DEF), the hold area for files being 
sent as FMail, the external protocols to be used etc etc.. The available 
keyword are as follows..


Command : SYSTEMPATH <full path to QBBS system files>
Example : systempath h:\qbbs\
Purpose : Tells QBBS FMail where to look for the USERS.BBS & DORINFO1.DEF 
          files.

Command : MAILAREA <path to a *.MSG and *.HDR files [NO EXTENSION]>
Example : mailarea h:\qbbs\msgs\0010
Purpose : QBBS FMail writes an FMail notification to whoever FMail is 
          being sent to, it also writes a receipt when an FMail item has 
          been received. All this is done in the message area named here. 
          Please note that all messages are sent with a PRIVATE status. If 
          no mailarea is specified then no message writing will be done. 
          On my own BBS I found it best to dedicate a message area (called 
          QBBS_FMail) for the use of QBBS FMail only.

Command : HOLDAREA <path to folder for holding FMail files>
Example : holdarea h:\qbbs\utils\fmail\hold\
Purpose : All files sent as FMail will be stored in this folder. You must 
          make sure that it does NOT point to a folder which is used by 
          other programs or has other files in it. This is because FMail 
          keeps a record of files in the folder and treats them all as 
          FMail, therefore when you delete received FMails all files which 
          are not on hold or do not have an FMail item entry will be 
          deleted.

Command : NOLOG
Example : nolog
Purpose : By default QBBS FMail will write entries into the SYSTEM.LOG, 
          UPLOAD.LOG & DOWNLOAD.LOG files when FMail is being received or 
          sent. With the NOLOG command this will be disabled and no LOG 
          writing will be done.

Command : LOGID <2 letter UL/DL log identification>
Example : logid QF
Purpose : The two defined letters will be used in the UPLOAD & DOWNLOAD 
          files to identify an FMail transfer. If no LOGID has been 
          defined QF (Qbbs Fmail) will be used as default.

Command : PROTOCOL
Example : protocol
Purpose : Starts a block of commands which are used to define and control 
          external transfer protocols. The block of commands _MUST_ end 
          with the END command. See example after list of commands. The
Command : END
Example : end
Purpose : Marks the end of an external protocol block of commands. This 
          _MUST_ be used otherwise problems will occur. The following 
          commands are all available ONLY when used within the PROTOCOL & 
          END block markers.

Command : KEY <letter>
Example : key J
Purpose : This is the letter which the user presses to select this 
          protocol from the protocol selection menu.

Command : NAME <text string>
Example : name Jekyll, Full Duplex
Purpose : The text used to describe the protocol when displayed in the 
          protocol selection menu.

Command : PATH <full path to external protocol program>
Example : path h:\qbbs\transfer\jekyll.ttp
Purpose : Defines the external protocol program to run when a user selects 
          the named KEY option.

Command : SEND <parameter list>
Example : send -ot1p*PATH
Purpose : This is the commandline passed to the program defined by the 
          PATH command when a user wants to 'SEND' any FMail using this 
          protocol. (The *PATH is replaced by the HOLDAREA path)

Command : RECV <parameter list>
Example : recv -ot1ph:\qbbs\uploads\ *FILE
Purpose : This is the commandline passed to the program defined by the 
          PATH command when a user want to 'RECEIVE' any waiting FMail 
          using this protocol. (The *FILE is replaced by the file being 
          received by them)

Command : ASKFILENAME
Example : askfilename
Purpose : When a user sends any FMail using a protocol with ASKFILENAME in 
          the command block they will be prompted for the name of the file 
          which they are sending before the transfer take place. This is 
          usually only needed by X-Modem drivers since X-Modem cannot get 
          the name of a file from the remote transfer program.


      For a clearer example of the way a protocol command block is made up 
      please see the enclosed example FILEMAIL.CTL file. This has been 
      setup to use Alan Hamiltons XYZ.TTP and Vincent Partingtons Jekyll 
      v1.32 (V1.36 will need different parameters to be passed)



                        - .TTP COMMANDLINE PARAMETERS -

         File Mailer is a .TTP program (Tos Takes Parameters) which means 
its operation is controlled by the type of instructions passed to it when 
it is first run, either by a .DOR file or on the commandline from desktop. 
There are four commands that can be passed which are RECEIVE, SEND, 
QUICKSCAN and SYSOP.. When QBBS FMail is run the .DOR file must also write 
a DORINFO1.DEF file in the same folder as USERS.BBS (The path defined in 
the SYSTEMPATH command).. The next sections will describe what each 
parameter does and how to use the resulting menus..


            >-------------------------------------------------<

QUICKSCAN - This will simply inform a user whether they have any FMail 
waiting and if so give them the option to receive it. If they decide to 
receive it they will be asked which transfer protocol they want to use, if 
not the FMail will be held until they do want to take it.. This is handy 
if there is a large file waiting and it isn't wanted on that particular 
call. If QUICKSCAN is run locally then a file is simply taken off hold 
rather than having to download it. This option is best run from the 
WELCOME.DOR file which QuickBBS executes immediatly after it has finished 
the mail check at log on..


            >------------------------------------------------<

Commandline 'SEND' Displays a menu with the following options :-

 [ S ] - Send FMail To Only One User

      Allows a user to send an FMail to any named user of the BBS. The 
      name entered will be checked to see if they are a valid user and if 
      not a warning will be displayed. (In local mode you can use the 
      fileselector to click on the file to send)

 [ M ] - Send FMail To More Than One User

      Allows a user to send one FMail file to more than one BBS user 
      without having to keep uploading the file. The user online will be 
      prompted to keep entering names until a blank line is entered. After 
      the transfer they will be given the chance to send a message to each 
      user seperatly or to write one message which will be sent to them 
      all. (In local mode you can use the fileselector to click on the 
      file to send)

            >------------------------------------------------<

Commandline 'SYSOP' displays a menu with the following options :-

 [ S ] - Send FMail To Only One User

      Allows a user to send an FMail to any named user of the BBS. The 
      name entered will be checked to see if they are a valid user and if

      the transfer they will be given the chance to send a message to each 
      user seperatly or to write one message which will be sent to them 
      all. (In local mode you can use the fileselector to click on the 
      file to send)

 [ V ] - View/Search The BBS User List

      Simply displays all the BBS users for easy hcecking of the users 
      names..

 [ E ] - Edit An FMail Item's Details

      Displays all the FMail items which are still in the FILEMAIL.IDX 
      file. This includes FMail which has been received or has no file in 
      the hold folder (identified under the HRN heading), these are only 
      removed from the FILEMAIL.IDX file when the delete option is used. 
      Allows you to edit the details of an FMail item, this includes the 
      name of who sent the file, who the file is to, the filename, the 
      status of the file and the message tagged with it.

 [ C ] - Cancel An FMail Item On Hold

      Allows you to change an FMail items status to R (Received) without 
      having to go through the longer task of editing it.

 [ R ] - Cancel Any Held FMail To You

      Automatically scans for FMail on hold for the sysop and asks if you 
      want it to be changed to Received status. If YES is selected then an 
      'FMail Receipt' message will be sent if a message area has been 
      defined.

 [ D ] - Delete Received FMail FILES

      Removes all the RECEIVED FMail (and N status [NO FILE FOUND]) items 
      from the FILEMAIL.IDX and also deletes files no longer on hold from 
      the holdarea folder. Each 'delete' is questioned so you can still 
      leave specific items in the FILEMAIL.IDX file.

 [ Q ] - Quit The Sysop Admin Menu

      Quits the Sysop admin menu and returns you to the calling menu or 
      the BBS depending on where it was called from.

         If you do experiance any problems check to see if a file called 
ERROR.LOG has been created in the same folder as the main FMail program, 
this will hopefully have some details regarding any possible problems 
which may help you to solve it, if you cannot find the problem yourself 
then please send me a copy of the ERROR.LOG and I will try to see what can 
be going wrong..

         QBBS FMail is 'CARRIER' intelligent, this means that it will 
automatically run in local mode if no carrier is detected when the program 
is first run. If a carrier existed when QBBS FMail was started it will 
then constantly check the modem carrier and will exit if the carrier is 
lost..

         Please feel free to mail me at anytime with any problems you may 
be having and also any ideas for new features, also feel free to make any 
donations of any kind (Money, new PD, your own programs etc). I always 
support my programs whether you have registered or not, I think it only 
fair since you have taken the time to use them :-)

                            ---< DISCLAIMER >---

      Many hours of writing and testing have been spent on QBBS FMail and 
      as yet it has never trashed a harddisk or ruined any other files, 
      this does not mean the program is totally bug free though and that 
      it will work without problems so you use it at your own risk.


Happy FMailing...
