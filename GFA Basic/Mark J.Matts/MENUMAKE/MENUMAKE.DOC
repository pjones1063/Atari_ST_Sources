                             (test release)


This is the first public release of  a  small utility that I wrote for my
own use to aid the making of  GEM  menus  within GFA Basic a lot quicker,
and for the beginner, a lot easier.  I  have  tried to make it as easy to
use as possible but as  it  was  originally  written for myself you might
find some of the menu options  and  prompts a little confusing. Hopefully
this document should help.

                          -- Copyright Stuff --

Version 1.0 is totally Public Domain. All I ask is that the program file,
MENUMAKE.PRG, and  this  MENUMAKE.DOC  file  stay  together.  All  future
releases of  MenuMaker  will  be  released  as  Licenceware  and  will be
available  through  any  PD  library   that   is   a  member  of  the  PD
Confederation. ONLY version 1.0 is available from anywhere.


                 --- How It Works (or Does It Work?) ---

When you first try to  save  any  work  you  have  done, the program will
create a folder on the root directory of the drive from which the program
was started, this also  includes  hard  drives,  called MENUMAKE. In this
folder all the files created will be  stored. The idea of this feature is
to keep all the menu files and final source code in one directory instead
of all over the place, this is if  your anything like me anyway. When you
create a menu it can be saved  as  raw  data  so it can be re-loaded at a
later date and added to or changed. When  it is saved as code a GFA Basic
file in ASCII format, should have a .LST extension, is created. This code
can be merged into GFA Basic and run immediately. The only thing you have
to add is the  routines  for  your  program.  There  are certain do's and
dont's but I will explain  these  in  their specific sections later. When
you are creating the menu any entries  can have the routine that they are
to call entered, this is  optional  and  the  final source code will have
Procedure and return commands  for  them  ready  made,  also the function
within GFA Basic that  calls  a  Procedure  when  it  is selected will be
included, again, this is only if  the  procedure to be called was entered
into MenuMaker. If no procedure  was  entered  the  only code created for
that entry is for the actual code  needed to create the display menu, not
the call routines. Examine the source code to see how it works if you are
a beginner. Throughout the creation of your  menu you can always see what
the finished product will look like as  there is a test menu function, so
there is no need to keep saving  the  source  code and having to merge it
into GFA Basic. The code produced has  been  tested on GFA Basic v2.0 and
v3.6 and it worked without  any  problems,  SO  FAR. Whenever any code is
created it will always allow the  maximum  of 6 desktop accessories to be
selected from the first menu list. You  do  not have to enter any details
about these as the program will do it automatically.


The following sections will try to explain what each menu option does and
how to use it. Each section title will show the menu heading and the menu
entry to be found under it.

Info
----
GFA MenuMaker

This is just a small  information  screen. Any desktop accessories loaded
will be displayed below this line.


File
----
Load Menu Info

Loads a raw menu data file.


File
----
Save Menu Info

Saves a raw menu data file.


File
----
Quit MenuMaker

Need I say more? The option to save any work is given before quitting.

Options
-------
Clear Present Menu

*** USE WITH CAUTION ***  Any menu data held in memory will be deleted so
make sure any work you have done has been saved. This is used to clear an
old menu so a new one can be started.

Options
-------
Add New Menu Heading

You will be prompted for a menu  heading name. This is the text displayed
above the line all the time. As  you enter them MenuMaker will create the
menu bar in the same order from  the  left.  There can be a maximum of 10
menu headings but you must  be  careful  not  to  go  off  the end of the
screen.

Options
-------
Delete A Menu List

You can delete a complete dropdown menu by choosing the menu heading. Use
this function with care. Once a  list  has been deleted the existing menu
details that came after it  are  moved  into  its place. Any deleted list
cannot be recovered, unless it was saved on disk.

Options
-------
Add To Menu Heading

From here you can create the part of  the menu that drops down. First you
are asked to enter which menu heading  you  want  to add to. If it is the
first heading you can only add 1  item because of having to reserve space
for any desktop accessories. This  is  a  feature  of  GEM that cannot be
changed. Any other headings can  have  up  to  20 entries. After you have
entered this you can then enter the  name  of the procedure to be called.
This is optional, but if it  is  entered  the appropriate GFA commands to
call this procedure are created when the  menu is saved as code. Also the
procedure command and return are  done.  All  you  need do then is insert
your own code in between these two lines for example:-

        you enter the menu name  as  TEST  and  the procedure as TESTONE.
Menumaker will create the code to check  if TEST was chosen from the menu
and if so will branch off to the line PROCEDURE TESTONE, after which your
code will be run and then the  last  line entered by MenuMaker which will
be RETURN which will go back  to  monitoring  the  menu again. Try it and
see. When you enter a procedure name  you  cannot have any spaces but you
can use the underscore, for example you  cannot have TEST ONE but you can
have TEST_ONE.


Options
-------
Edit A Menu Entry

First you select the menu heading and  then the menu entry. From here you
can change the menu entry and the procedure to call.

Options
-------
Delete A Menu Entry

As the name suggests you can delete  a  menu entry, First choose the menu
heading and then the menu  entry  to  be  deleted. All other menu entries
below the deleted one will be shifted to fill its space.

Options
-------
Test Menu So Far

You can see what your finished menu will look like without having to save
it and quit the program. The  screen  colours  will change to the default
desktop colours and  your  menu  bar  will  be  shown,  complete with the
dropdown menus. Move the mouse over  the  menu  headings to see what they
will look like. This is a new feature written in for the v1.0 release. To
return to the 'REAL' menu just click  the right mouse button. Any changes
or deletions you make will  always  be  shown  here so keep checking your
menu.


Right, I think that's  about  it.  Hopefully  most  things will be simple
enough to follow, but I remember when I first started to program menus in
GFA and it took me hours  to  get  it  the  way I wanted it, this utility
should make life that bit easier. Not only that, IT'S FREE.

I am more than welcome to  receive  any letters giving me suggestions and
ideas to make the program  better  and  easier  to  use, or even a letter
letting me know if the program was of any use to you. As I am a member of
the PdC (Public Domain  Confederation)  as  a  Licenceware programmer all
future versions will be available from PdC  PD Libraries. One of which is
Jennix PD which can be contacted at  66  Abbey Rd, Strood, Kent, ME2 3QB.
Alternativly you can send me Two Pounds  and your address and I will send
you the next version, when it's done. Any users who give me ideas which I
use will be mentioned in the program, now is your chance to get your name
seen by hundreds of ST users, well 2 anyway, Me and You!

Thanks to the following:-

ST Format -

It was the GFA Surgery  section  that  made  me  release the program as I
was suprised at the amount of  questions  asked about GEM menus, also for
giving us  ST  users  a  great  magazine,  I  get  mine  every  month, DO
YOU?

Nick Klee -

A good friend who  runs  Jennix  PD  and  first  suggested that I release
some of the programs  I  have  written,  both  his  catalogue and invoice
programs are by me, and for introducing me to the PdC.

GFA Basic -

This must be the  Rolls  Royce  of  the  basic  programming languages. In
my 10 years of computing  as  a  hobby  I  have  never  used or admired a
program as much as I do this. If only all things were as good as GFA.

YOU! -

For taking the  time  to  read  this  document  and  for  possibly trying
out the program.  Please  let  me  know  what  you  think.  Just a letter
of appreciation (no money) will mean a lot.

Finally and most importantly -

My wife, Geraldine -

Thanks for my 2 wonderful sons, Richard & Daniel, and for putting up with
me being on the computer all  night.  I  love you... This mush is killing
me. The truth is as long as  she  gets  her go on Llamatron every now and
again, she's happy.
