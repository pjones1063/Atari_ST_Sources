
Hi Mr Sysop,

	Over the past year or so you may have either heard of, seen or used 
some of my QBBS support programs such as SplitZ, QBBS Fmail etc.. Well, 
the time has come for me to update my BBS software to a more powerful, more
configurable and better supported package known as RATsoft,  obviously 
because of this I will no longer be supporting QBBS and therfore not 
writing any more programs or updating the existing ones.

	As the source code to my programs is no longer of use to me I have 
come to the decision that it is only fair to release the full source codes 
to all my programs (apart from Make FILES.BBS * See later) so that anyone 
can continue to develop them or simply customise their own version. I 
would still like to know how the development goes on any updated & 
released versions though so a netmail from whoever did the update letting 
me know what new features or fixes have been implemented will be greatly 
appreciated. I am still happy to answer any questions about the source 
that you may have.

	Regarding Make FILES.BBS, this program uses some commercial source 
code routines (GUI-4-GFA) which means I will not be releasing it 
publically, I will however welcome any applications from anyone who is 
seriously interested in the further development of this program (All source 
in GFA 3.6).. I will eventually release it to one person so write a 
netmail to me quickly if your interested, you will also receive the full 
release version of GUI-4-GFA should you need it for further development!!

	  You can contact me on:	 NeST - 90:100/101.0
				     AtariNet - 51:6/4.0
				      FidoNet - 2:255/320.0


	I wish you all luck with QBBS in the future, hopefully before 1995 
you will see a release version of 1.09 (grin)...
