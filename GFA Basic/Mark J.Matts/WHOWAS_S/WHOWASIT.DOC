         WhoWasIt is a program for QuickBBS that creates a chart for the last 
specified number of callers. The chart is created in all four flavors used by 
QuickBBS, that is ASC, VTC, VTM and ANS. It is very quick at running, usually 
under 1 second, unless you run a floppy disk based BBS (why?), so it doesn't 
keep the BBS offline for too long between callers.

         Setting it up is _VERY_ easy.. All you have to do is place the 
WHOWASIT.PRG file in any folder on any partition along with a CTL file called 
WHOWASIT.CTL. This file only contains three lines but it is needed for 
WhoWasIt to work correctly. The format of the CTL file is as follows..

12
h:\qbbs\
h:\qbbs\text\whowasit

         The file must be in exactly the same format where line 1 is the 
amount of last callers you want to show on the chart, line 2 is the full path 
to the system files, I use this in all my programs because I do not trust 
environment variables, and finally the last line is the full path and filename 
(less extension) of the chart files to be created. WhoWasIt will add the 
correct file extensions to match the graphic flavor of each chart.

         There are no commandlines that have to be passed, you simply run it 
from your batch file after every caller. If the last caller calls again they 
will not be added to the list, this is so that your last caller list doesn't 
fill up with the same name if one user keeps ringing up.

         Ok, thats all there is to it.. You shouldn't have problems but if you 
do please contact me and I will do all I can to help.. The same goes for any 
suggestions you may have to make changes to it..

         Please feel free to mail me at anytime with any problems you may 
be having and also any ideas for new features, also feel free to make any 
donations of any kind (Money, new PD, your own programs etc). I always 
support my programs whether you have registered or not, I think it only 
fair since you have taken the time to use them :-)
