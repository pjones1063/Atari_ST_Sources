      Topper is a 'fun' utility for QuickBBS which will create 4 different 
charts for the best callers, the best message writers, the best uploaders and 
the best (or is it the worst!) downloaders. Each of the chart screens created 
will also be in four graphic formats, .ASC, .VTC, .VTM and .ANS

      To use topper you must setup a small .CTL file called TOPPER.CTL which 
MUST be placed in the same folder as the main Topper program. This .CTL file 
consists of 6 lines which are as follows:-

line 1 - The number of how many users you want to include in the lists.
line 2 - The full path to the USERS.BBS file
line 3 - Path and filename for the top message writers chart
line 4 - Path and filename for the top uploaders chart
line 5 - Path and filename for the top downloaders chart
line 6 - Path and filename for the top callers chart.

   PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FILENAMES GIVEN FOR THE CHARTS _MUST_NOT_ HAVE AN 
   EXTENSION ON BECAUSE TOPPER WILL GIVE EACH CHART THE CORRECT EXTENSION 
   DEPENDING ON THE GRAPHIC MODE USED FOR THE FILE.

      There is a commented example file included. You can leave the comments 
in without affecting the operation of Topper as long as there is a space 
between each command and its comment. The number of users to include in the 
charts can be anything you want, even if it is higher than the number of users 
on your BBS.

      Because you give the path to the USERS.BBS file in the .CTL file you can 
have Topper in any folder and on any partition. That is all there is to it. 
You can run Topper from the desktop or from a batch file at any time. The 
SYSOP's details will NOT be included in the charts.

      If you have any problems with this program or a suggestion for 
improving it then please get in touch. I am always happy to help.

         Please feel free to mail me at anytime with any problems you may 
be having and also any ideas for new features, also feel free to make any 
donations of any kind (Money, new PD, your own programs etc). I always 
support my programs whether you have registered or not, I think it only 
fair since you have taken the time to use them :-)
