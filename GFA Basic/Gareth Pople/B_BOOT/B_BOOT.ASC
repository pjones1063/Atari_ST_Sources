The programs in this folder have been specially collected for those ST 
owners who, like me, have double sided drive B, but only single sided 
drive A. No longer will you need to keep all your accessories and auto 
loading programs on poxy single sided disks. Using the B_BOOT.PRG you 
may specify which drive you wish your system to boot from. You may 
also be able to boot from a hard disk or eternal ram disk, although 
this has not been tested.

Changing the boot drive however does not solve all the problems. Some 
programs and many accessories specifically look on drive A for their 
resource files. One answer is to put all the those resource files onto 
a single sided disk, after all you still need at least one single 
sided disk to initially boot your system. There is another better 
solution, but it requires you to alter the offending program with a 
sector/file editor. You must look through an ASCII listing of the 
program looking for the string which specifies the name of the 
resource to be loaded, this will typically be in the form 
"filename.rsc" and to make the program load the file off drive B it 
must be changed to "b:\fname.rsc" and the filename of the resource 
must be altered correspondingly, this will always shorten the length 
of the name but will certainly work. 

Included in this folder is a copy of Eric Robshaws excellent 
accessory loader, that has been converted to rename and load 
accessories from drive B when used in conjunction with the boot disk 
setter. Together with this are several* accessories modified to load 
their resource files from drive B. I hope this information proves to 
be useful.

accessories suitable for loading from drive B are available on PD 
disk DES.03
