R           Resource Programming with GFA Basic

                         Part 1

Welcome to a new tutorial, on how to use Resource files with GFA Basic
(versions 2 and 3  Basics will be catered for). Over the next few issues, John
Peters will present programs and advice for the management of Resource files.

A Gentle introduction

Let's assume you have written a program, which requires the user to select
between saving data to Drive A, or B. You could use an Alert box, which most of
you will have seen, or you could draw some boxes for the user to click in, thus
indicating the Drive of their choice; as seen below:
______  ______
| A  |  | B  |
ÿÿÿÿÿÿ  ÿÿÿÿÿÿ
The problem would be, that first you would have to draw these boxes, using a
drawing program, such as Degas etc. and then cut out the bits you want, load
these bits into your program, and now the real fun starts; your program would
have to detect where the mouse is, and if you clicked inside one of the boxes,
which one it was, and then
