ÅTHE VIRUS DESTRUCTION UTILITY Äby Richard Karsmakers

The day after I discovered that viruses were going around on  the 
Atari ST,  Frank Lemmen started writing a virus killer (a program 
that  eliminated  the virus from infected disks).  He  wrote  two 
versions:  The  first one was filled with bugs (didn't work  with 
RAM-and harddisks,  for example), and the second one was believed 
to be full proof as well.  But,  as days passed,  some additional 
more  or  less  major shortcomings of Frank's  new  virus  killer 
showed up:

      * You could only check drive A's infected disks (trouble
          with people who had a 5,25" drive B)
      * It could only recognize one specific virus on disk
      * To work with it, you had to use keyboard AND mouse
      * One could not IMMUNIZE disks with it






The "Virus Destruction Utility" has the following features:

- It recognizes and automatically destroys infected disks' virus
- A formerly infected disk is also immunized (so that the current
   virus will not be written on it ever again)
- You can also immunize your normal, non-infected disks
- Cases of doubt (any executable bootsectors) are recognized  and 
   you are warned (please note:  This option was included to make 
   the  VDU  compatible with future viruses,  and  all  auto-boot 
   programs use these as well - not being a virus!)
- It  works  on drive A as well as B (easy if you  have  a  5,25" 
   drive B)
- It  recognizes  a  virus  that  is  already  installed  in  the 
   computer.  The VDU will then refuse to work!  If a virus might 
   get onto your VDU disk,  simply boot with a non-infected  disk 
   and then load the VDU.

List of programs that auto-boot,  and of which the VDU will  tell 
that  it 'may be infected by a virus' (there may be more -  these 
are  all  ORIGINAL  versions):   Deep  Space,  Arena,  Brataccas, 
Starglider,    Barbarian,   Terrorpods,   Obliterator,   Sapiens, 
Sentinel, all Aladin disks, Tai Pan, the BIG Demo (from TEX).
The  version  of the Virus Destruction Utility in  this  ÅST  NEWSÄ 
Volume  2  Compendium is a somewhat enhanced version of  the  one 
published in the original ÅST NEWSÄ Volume 2 Issue 8.  From now on, 
newer  versions of the virus killer will be appearing in ÅST  NEWSÄ 
issues regularly.

Just look at the program (written in GfA Basic),  and the remarks 
will show you how it all works.  I hope to have supplied you with 
a useful tool in your battle against viruses.  It is not only for 
your own sake,  but your duty towards other ST users to fight the 
ST virus! Kill 'em all!
