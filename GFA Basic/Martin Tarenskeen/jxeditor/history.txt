About JXEDITOR version 0.7-8b (15 January 2003)


History
=======
version 0.7-8b:
- Implemented Import and Export of data as Standard Midi File.
- Bulkdump to JX10/M-64C waits for ACK messages before proceeding,
instead of using a fixed delay time between the packets.

version 0.7-7b:
- Fixed a bug that was only shown when loading big files with too 
many tones/patches.

version 0.7-6b:
- The midi dump-in exited spontaneously when used for a second
  time. Fixed.

version 0.7-5b:
- Progress bar makes dump-out proces visible.
- Fixed a little bug concerning the midi delay variable.

version 0.7-4b:
- Copy or swap tones and patches in the library by dragging and
  dropping. This is beginning to look like a real bankmanager !!
  Selecting of patches: not finished yet.
- Alphabetical sort also for patches (F1).
- Automatic updating of the patchbank, when copying or swapping
  tones in the library. Must think about making that work with
  the tone sort function too.
- Other channels than midich. #1 didn't work for many functions.
  Oops. Why didn't I test other channels before ? fixed.
- Changed name of COLORS.INF into JXEDITOR.INF. It can now be 
  used to set defaults for other things than just colors namely
  Midichannel, Midi delaytime for Sysex dumps, and favourite 
  synth. Not required but it can make things easier sometimes.
- Added an end-of-dump detection method with automatic time out 
  for the dumputility. It does not time out automatically if you
  haven't started dumping anything yet, giving you plenty of 
  time to walk to your synth that is attached via a 10 meter 
  long midicable to your Atari in the other room ;-)

version 0.7-3b:
- First steps towards better MKS70/JX10 patch support. Still much
  to be done.
- Print patchlist with numbers of the 2 used tones for each patch.
- Select tonelist or patchlist to be displayed with normal or small
  font. Click on the small list to toggle between display modes.
- Fixed a display bug in 256 color mode.
- Long dumps can be interupted using the <Space> bar. Can be useful
  if you accidently have set a delaytime of 9999 ms for a JX10 dump,
  and have forgot to connect your JX10. :-)   

version 0.7-2b:
- Fileselector startpath was lost when selecting CANCEL sometimes.
- JX10 export disabled and removed from menu, if no MKS70 or JX10
  patchdata are present in the library.
  
version 0.7-1b:
- Forgot to put EOX message at the end of JX-10 (M-64C) export- and
  dump-sequence. fixed.

version 0.7b:
- Replaced some original sourcecode from the anonymous author with
  my own. Makes combination with the newly added code easier for me.
- Changed method of transporting edit-tone from the editor to the 
  library manager. You can now select a location inside the library
  to store the edited tone, or append the new tone to the library.
- Added support for receiving JX10 (M-64C) bulk dumps !
  
version 0.6-8b:
- More different GenPatch files can be imported now !
- JX10 (M-64C) files are loaded significantly faster.

version 0.6-7b:
- removed some unused code
- completion of tonenames in editor to 10 characters, using spaces.

version 0.6-6b:
- When exporting a single tone the MKS70/JX8P mode as chosen in the 
  editor could be changed without knowing. Doesn't happen anymore.   
- version info alert
- forgot to block underlying library window against mouseclicks in
  the menu/help window.

version 0.6-5b:
- Restyled Help menu window. Items now selectable with a mouseclick.

version 0.6-4b:
- JX-10 cartridge dump files in GenPatch format (16538 bytes)
  can also be imported now.
- Added some color to the library screen.
- JX-8P bulkdump without toneselect.
- ASCII values below 32 now only replaced by spaces for printing on paper.

version 0.6-2b:
- fixed 2 serious bugs: 
  The new MIDI out function didn't work.
  The order of tones was reversed when loading a bank since 0.5-6. 
  Oops.
- Alternative easier to remember keyboard shortcuts in the library
  manager.
- Print a list of tone & patch names on paper. ( Hit <p> )

version 0.6b:
- Changed library functions F9/F10. No longer a universal 
  "dumb-utility", but a better JXEDITOR specific library
  to/from MIDI support. Load or Receive a bank, and directly 
  send it to any of the supported synths in a correct format.
  Still to do: full bi-directional support for JX-10 cartridge 
  dump format.

version 0.5-6:
- Added a few alerts to make things easier.
- Helpscreen slightly improved.
- When importing MKS-70 and JX-10 patch/tone banks the patchdata 
  are kept in memory, without being used for anything but making 
  the following possible:
- Export of MKS-70 bulkdump with 50 tones AND 64 patches.
- Export of JX-10 Cartridge dump format.
- New concept: Tones or banks are now inserted at the start of a
  library instead of being added at the end. This change was needed
  to make it easier to keep MKS-70/JX10 patches and corresponding tones
  together when exporting as SysEx bulkdump file.
- fixed a bug in .BAK file renaming.

version 0.5-5:
- Found a big bug in the Alert dialog that hang the system when 
  trying to select JX8P/MKS-70. I wasn't satified with the 
  support for the MKS-70 double tone architecture anyway. Time 
  to design a new better method: This version has a comfortable 
  way to address both tones (A and B) separetely when getting or 
  sending tones. Simply by left-clicking (=A) or right-clicking 
  (=B) on the "GET TONE" button in the editor, or on the 
  tonenames in the library. As a result of this, leaving the 
  library screen with the right mouse button isn't possible 
  anymore. Use <Esc> or <q> now.

version 0.5-4:
- testplaying of sounds by clicking the mouse in the lowest part of the
  screen. With nice on-screen keyboard if you have 640x480 screen.
- rewrote GET TONE routine (editwindow). Should work with MKS-70 as well
  as with JX8P. 

version 0.5-3:
- Transmission of SysEx bulkdumps with the dump utility can be 
  slowed down with an editable time interval.
- Added support for JX-8P Super Librarian format (import only)
- Automatic filename suggestion when saving files
- Program can be started with a file(name) from the desktop.

version 0.5-alpha,  a major update! :
- Major changes in the internal library management system. 
  Many new options in the LIBRARY section resulted from this:
  Flexible import and export functions, built-in universal dump utility,
  a HELP screen to show you the way to all these new goodies ;)
  Read README.TXT for more details.
- fixed a stupid bug in the "delete" function introduced in 0.4-5.
- Tonedata are now sent to both Tone A and Tone B (MKS-70)
- Faster redraw in the editscreen for the good old ST-HIGH resolution. 
- Split the documentation in two: HISTORY.TXT and README.TXT

version 0.4-5:
- Fixed an error that caused the library screen to scroll when selecting
  the last tone in a row.
- Added an alertbox for unknown fileformats (I hope you won't see it often) 
- Added option to delete a tone from a library.

version 0.4-4:
- JX-10 can save the data from a M-64C cartridge to SysEx via a handshake
  protocol. JXEDITOR can load such dumps from disk, and read the tonedata.
  (Pfff...this was a hard one. There are two different formats, caused by
  two different JX-10 system ROMs. And the SysEx docs didn't help me much 
  either. The JX-10 SysEx implementation really sucks, the MKS-70 is much
  better)
 
version 0.4-3:
- MKS-70 dump format also recognized. (50 tones used in 64 patches)
- Multitasking "resistant". Meaning: I can now use the program with a 
  multistasking OS (I've tested with MiNT). Don't expect too much of it.
  I've simply blocked the complete background.
  To be honest: Not recommended.

version 0.4:
- Automatic intelligent file import. (See above)
  
version 0.3:
- New intelligent fileselector routines. 
- Fileselector fixed for use with Falcon
- Now can run with 16+ colors, with user definable colors !!
- Removed Roland fancy-font logo. Didn't work in color modes.
- Less fancy but more effective tone-name editing.

version 0.2:
Removed the external fonts. They only gave trouble, were not found when
remote-starting the program and were needed but not used when NVDI was
installed. And they needed a lot of programming code.

The beginning: version 0.1
I got the original Gfa source file, made by an unknown programmer, 
from a fellow Atarian in the comp.sys.atari.st usenet newsgroup.
Please contact me if you know (or are) this unknown programmer. 
I especially liked the good looking PG-800 look-alike screen. The
library concept I did not like much, and was to be rewritten completely.
I don't have any of these Roland synths, but it was quite easy to make
a few improvements to the original code. There was no manual or any
other proper documentation. 

I did this just for fun. I hope you will enjoy it too.
