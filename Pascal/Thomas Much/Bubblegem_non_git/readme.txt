BubbleGEM Source Code
=====================
Copyright (c)1997-98 by Thomas Much

The development of BubbleGEM is finished, at least it offers all features that
*I* need. Of course there are things that would be nice to have, but I simply
do not have enough time to implement them. So, if you are missing a feature,
you can do it yourself now :-)

If you create a new BubbleGEM version, please do not distribute it under my
name. Still, all BubbleGEM distributions must have the copyright notice
"BubbleGEM copyright 1997-98 by Thomas Much".
If you only have a few lines of source code to add to my version (e.g. a
bug fix), please feel free to contact me, so maybe we can release a new
"official" version together. Your additions must be free of copyright, or
the owner of the copyright must have granted the release of the source code
and the free distribution of the compiled version.

The source code is provided "as is" without any warranty.
